This repository features three files relating to web-scraping Milwaukee bar reviews for a consultancy case. The python script shows the webscraper itself, which uses beautiful soup to create the milwaukee_ratings.csv file. The final r script shows some basic analyses which were run to gain some insights on the scraped data (regression, covariate analysis, etc.)
