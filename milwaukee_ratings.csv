My company is in the deer district so we got the VIP invitation. We got to try some of their fun bucket drinks, appetizers, and hear electrifying music. My fav was the cherry limeade drink. The sex on the moon drink was also a group fav. They brought singers in from their other locations and it was awesome! They take recommendations from the crowd and did a great job executing and involving the audience. We were celebrating one of our coworkers hitting a milestone and they announced it and got him on stage! If you're looking for a place for a group, just a few friends or a date night, this is a solid option. The location is phenomenal and in the heart of the deer district. I can't imagine there will be a weekend night this place will not be packed.",154,"Milwaukee, WI",1,0,0,0

Place was fairly packed, so maybe more a me issue here, but the dual piano/band was so bad. Every song is a full band production now. What happened to a dual piano song? I haven't been since Covid hit, now just a loud crappy band college bar. Everyone in our group and the table next to us just laughed at the band.

The drinks are absolutely fantastic, especially their gin drinks. The whole place has such a cozy and cool vibe to it. Love all the knickknacks and artwork on the walls. It can fill up quickly on weekends, but it's worth the wait. Weeknights are super nice because it's very mellow. Love the couch and chairs in the back! The lighting, ambiance, noise level, and overall atmosphere is perfect for just relaxing with a drink (or two!) and some friends. Will be going back over and over again!",95,"Milwaukee, WI",1,1,0,0

I am super glad we stopped here on a whim. The group that we were with was also super complementary of this place as well. We all we're saying it's a cool place to go to and how we want to go back. The drinks were really good. I admit that I am not a drink expert but I do know that I like to taste the alcohol in my drinks and not have it be watered down. You can tell they clearly know what they are doing with their drinks and have a real science behind them. This isn't just any old bartender throwing together cocktails. The ambience was awesome. The people there were totally chill and there was no feeling of pretentiousness which I appreciated. Everybody in my group would appreciate it. If you want to feel a little swanky, you can roll with that vibe. But if you want to come in feeling chill, with no makeup and your hair in a pony, wearing your every day clothes, that too works as well. I really appreciate that vibe. I can't recall the prices but I definitely didn't think they were extreme or out of line. We will be going back. Completely happy we stopped here and thanking a friend for the recommendation.",224,"Mequon, WI",0,0,0,1

It's a combination of all the things: Bartenders who not only know their spirits and can mix a perfectly rendered classic cocktail but who are also always warm and welcoming, a cozy atmosphere that puts one immediately at one's ease, and, of course, the multitude of whiskey and gin options.It's the total package.During these safer-at-home times, the Tin Widow has quickly pivoted to begin providing classic cocktail kits for at-home mixing. We've happily purchased a couple of their whiskey Old Fashioned kits (some of the best Old Fashioned cocktails around, friends) as well as a martini kit (perfection). They've even arranged to have a food truck there pretty regularly (Milk Can Hamburgers & Frozen Custard) so you can pick up some burgers (so good!), grab a cocktail kit, and be on your way to enjoy a delicious evening at home. My heart is filled with such gratitude for this business and everyone affiliated with it. I look forward to regular trips to grab a cocktail kit to go until we're able to enjoy a Widow Manhattan in house once again.Thanks for being the best of the very best.",214,"Milwaukee, WI",1,31,6,31

A unique bar unlike any other I have been to before! The amount of spirits that they have in this bar is simply amazing. I found myself taking pictures like crazy since I couldn't believe the bottles they had available! Even better, is the bar staff. I was there early on a Friday night with a group of 6, and we were the only ones in the bar other than another couple. We were slightly overwhelmed by the options, but the bartender was SO GOOD! She asked what we liked, and recommended options that were both on the cocktail menu, and options that she could make or modify to suit our tastes. What we thought would be a one-drink stop, turned into a 4 hour evening at the corner of the bar, enjoying the cozy atmosphere, great service, and delicious drinks.Fun Fact: the owl lamp doesn't have a name, I asked!",170,"Milwaukee, WI",1,6,2,6

Finding the speakeasy was definitely more difficult than it needed to be - only because we were so distracted by the floor to rooftop murals down Black Cat Alley. I was in absolute awe. Once we arrived, the atmosphere was at its utmost intimate. Only lit by candles, close in proximity - amazing for a couples night out. The drinks were fabulous, hitting more tastebuds in my palate than I could handle at moments. We got drinks that I couldn't tell you the name of.

We were floored by how beautiful the interior was, the handcrafted cocktails and the outstanding service. The decor is reminiscent of a 1920s East Asian style which is unique to the traditional western Roaring 20s vibe you normally see in American speakeasies. The drinks were absolutely outstanding. I don't normally like cocktails as they are usually too alcohol forward for me. The Shadow Boxer was very tea-forward and had aromatic quality that you don't often get to experience. I highly recommend making a reservation as I can see this place being very popular (as it should be!)",110,"Milwaukee, WI",1,2,0,1
Shanghai,https://www.yelp.com/biz/shanghai-milwaukee?osq=Bars,5,17,Speakeasies,1,,Rachel H.,5,7/29/2021,"Such a cool space and hidden gem on the east side. A great date night spot or small gathering - don't come with a huge group, the actual inside is very narrow and intimate though they do have a patio space in the alley. The drinks themselves were delicious and the decor was amazing. The only recommendation I'd give to them is to more fully close off the back near the bar from the rest of the crossroads. We sat near the bar and the curtain and open door by the bar took away a bit of the mood with noise and light coming from there. Very small thing though and definitely will.be coming back.",115,"New Berlin, WI",0,1,0,0

My SO ordered two drinks off the regular menu and was very happy with them, while I opted for ""dealer's choice"". The bartender was able to mix up a cocktail based on my liquor and taste preferences. Since I'm a gin lover, I got a fruity gin fizz, which was one of the better craft cocktails I've had in Milwaukee. The bartender was very friendly and attentive despite appearing overwhelmed with drink orders on this busy Friday night. Overall, this is a very small-but-cozy and uniquely curated bar. Definitely make reservations ahead of time to ensure a spot.",123,"Milwaukee, WI",1,1,0,1
Shanghai,https://www.yelp.com/biz/shanghai-milwaukee?osq=Bars,5,17,Speakeasies,1,,Abe C.,5,07/06/2021,"Yes I am all about this speakeasy! I've only been to two others speakeasies in my life, but this one takes the crown! If you enjoy hidden speakeasies and cocktails look no further. I heard of Shanghai from a friend when asking if they know any speakeasies in town. Let's say they made a really good recommendation to an enjoyable speakeasy. Shanghai is hidden in the black cat alley area and will need to buzz in just to get into the speakeasy. It's probably better to make a reservation for the speakeasy, but both times I went they weren't too busy so I was able to get in with no reservation. Once inside Shanghai you are instantly thrown back in time as if you were in the prohibition era. It is small inside which totally matches the vibe!Now the drinks is where Shanghai shines even brighter. Like I stated earlier this is more of a cocktail joint so they don't have many beer choices. However, the bartender can pretty much make whatever cocktail your heart desires. They have a good choice of unique mixed drinks on their menu, but my favorite is dealer's choice. This option you tell the bartender what you like and she'll make you a cocktail to that taste. Every time I go there I do this option and have never been disappointed!Another amazing part of Shanghai is the bartender. She is so friendly and fun to talk to. She makes Shanghai so much of a joy to be at. She gave us a run down on the history of speakeasies and even told us about some other really cool speakeasies throughout the country!Overall this is the place to go to! If you love cocktails Shanghai will be heaven for you. I recommend this place for any occasion from hanging with friends to a romantic date night. Shanghai is small so I would keep the group size on the smaller side.",324,"Milwaukee, WI",1,3,0,2

Shanghai,https://www.yelp.com/biz/shanghai-milwaukee?osq=Bars,5,17,Speakeasies,1,,Nadia H.,5,3/27/2021,"I had such a good experience at Shanghai last night. I made a reservation for me and two of my friends for a girls night and I have to say it is probably the perfect spot for a girls night or an intimate date. There is not a whole lot of room, so I would recommend getting a reservation just in case althoughI do believe they allow walk-ins only if there is space available. There was only one other couple seated while we were there, and I can't imagine they would be able to seat much more than that. I actually really love that because it made the whole experience feel exclusive and all the more special. If you do decide to come, i would recommend coming early to make sure you get a spot. I did have a hard time finding the entrance in the Black Cat Alley, but honestly I thought that was part of the fun trying to find where the door was! The setting is very romantic with it's dim lighting and is decorated with vintage posters. I ordered two cocktails: ""Turtles all the way down"" and a ""Dealer's choice"" where our bartender made a customized drink based on the alcohol/flavors that I like. Both drinks were so refreshing and delicious! Also strong but not overbearing. Our bartender was so nice, friendly, and invested in making sure we had a quality evening. I will definitely be coming back!",242,"Milwaukee, WI",1,1,0,1

Super seasoned, a little spicy, really creamy. Would get again! I had a team of 8 come from work and they were super accommodating and food came out quick. We got some good drinks and we loved the LIT flights. My coworkers said the burgers were really good as well. Absolutely no complaints on the food. Also shocked they are open for lunch.

It is time to say goodbye.In the early 2000s, Rachel Ray featured this restaurant in her ""$40 a Day"" show. My siblings and I visited and had a lot of fun.Today (2/24/2022), I hyped it up to my husband and we decided to go so I can show him how much fun it was, but we were disappointed. The good:+ Some staff were super nice (lady you meet when you open the door), the male bar tender, and our waiter. The rest were ""meh"". No greeting when you arrive and leave, no acknowledgement, nothing. The so so:+- Food was ok. Not bad, not great either. The bad:- Restaurant and bathroom looks dirty and dusty- ""entertainment"" that used to be free now require payment: the phone booth now requires a credit card payment for you to get your secret mission- The restaurant now charges a $3 entertainment fee in your check (which is fine...Covid surcharge...but I wish there was a bit of effort with the entertainment)- Some booths are there but no explanation on what they were there for- The drone reconnaissance monitor was not working (It said to tap the drone location but nothing happened when we did it.) - I noticed some people got mustaches and a postcard and were walking around the restaurant looking for clues. We did not get that. I wish we did. That's the reason we went there! To do some some fun ""spy stuff"".

There were 5 in our party. It was a cool concept. The server was nice. If you want to come here, come for a drink. Avoid the food. Every meal sucked. I tried the blt sandwich. When you order a bacon sandwich you would think it has more than one slice of bacon for the entire sandwich. It wasn't peppered bacon or whatever the menu says. It was some sort of cheap breakfast bacon. It was thin and tasted like maple.  There was also one slice of turkey. The sandwich has no sauce, no Mayo no nothing. It was so bland and dry that I put ranch dressing on my sandwich to be able to eat it... and I'm not even a big ranch fan.. but this sucker was as dry as could be. The kids couldn't care less about their chicken tenders and my sisters beef dip sandwich was flavorless and bland. For the prices they charge, you would think that there would be some decent quality.. If you wanna save some money.. eat a handful of sand.

The waiter was very friendly and nice.However the wait for food was terrible! We finally got the food around 7:15. It came out one by one, so some of us had food before the others. In total, from the first dish out, it took about 20 minutes for the 5th dish to come out. So our first diners finished eating before the last diner did, we wanted to wait but then the food would've been cold.On the other hand the food was DELICIOUS, we didn't take any photos because we were so hungry. We ordered the impossible burger, UN Burger, chicken sandwich, bacon mac and cheese, and a prime rib sandwich. Everyone loved their food.The menu drinks were not that great either. The spytini tasted like straight grey goose, it was gross. The Long Island flight was OK but incredibly sugary.

Most importantly, the staff was attentive, the food was PROMPT and HOT and DELICIOUS. We recommend the mission impossible burger & the mac and cheese.  We also eyed up some nachos on the way out that we definitely want to try on our next visit.Not only did they make things right with us, but they rectified things with my parents as well (with whom we split the bill the first time).  They credited their card for the first meal and offered to comp their next visit as well.It's inevitable when running a business that mistakes will be made, but what matters is how you respond. I can honestly say that the SafeHouse went above and beyond to correct their mistakes and show us what true Milwaukee hospitality is all about.  The SafeHouse management are a class act and I am proud that they call Milwaukee home.

Although the atmosphere was relaxed, there was a sophisticated nature to the bar. The drink menu impressed me.

I went for the Miltown Mule and my boyfriend ordered one of the speciality cocktails with whiskey. We both enjoyed our drinks and look forward to returning!

Not only were the owners thoughtful in what they wanted to create in the former Boone and Crocket space, they had specific ideas about water conservation and eco-friendly aspects of cocktails (even before the big fight against straws started!) They taught Ben and the rest of the staff from A to Z of the classics of cocktails, all while pushing the innovative limits of creative drink flavor combinations as well items to elevate drinks from the garnishes, to the glasses to the ice. Ben is now working in radio, but we've kept Lost Whale as our most active ""going out"" place. They handled Covid in the safest and most amazing way. They closed inside and went with selling cocktail kits. Then, they opened up the Pufferfish tiki tent in their backyard. During Covid when we were figuring out what to do, BEN AND I LITERALLY GOT MARRIED THERE.It was the most perfect place, since we had gotten engaged there the summer before and the tent was just the right size for our small Covid wedding party. The classic cocktails will always satisfy you (they have an old fashion that will make you go weak in the knees), all while Lost Whale is constantly looking to thrill and push the boundaries - incorporation of burned wood to trap smokiness in a glass, installation of a fancy highball machine and even a new gun that creates a bubble with vapor inside! Always using new technology, bringing new flavors and figuring out creative marketing and special things that make their drinks truly unique. We were just there for Valentine's Day with their incredibly safe social distanced inside (officially open) and went through nearly more than half the menu (thank goodness we ubered.) These are the type of local business owners that need our support now more than ever. They care, they're doing it right and they're creative.",383,"Bay View, Milwaukee, WI",0,5,2,6

I told the server I really like gin and tonics and drinks with a hint of floral or fruit taste while one of my friends told the server that they really like chocolate and sweet drinks.

Well, they go to a create-your-own mini golf course, where else?! Once I figured that out, I wanted to check it out. We went in January for a birthday Sunday funday with a group of 5. Although mini golf sounds like a kid-friendly activity, Nine Below is definitely an adult atmosphere, you walk right into the bar area at the bottom of the stairs. They stick with the golf theme, the bartenders are dressed in polos and visors and they have golf drink specials along with some good beer options. The space is bigger than it looks from the outside, they could have 20+ groups going at once. There weren't a ton of other groups when we went but they had left some holes set up from previous rounds so we still had a lot of holes to golf. We did a round of Maker's Golf. At the beginning of your two hours, the employees explain the rules and then let you have about 45 minutes to create your hole including gathering props from the prop room, giving it a name, and determining par. Each group tries to outdo the next with clever prop and name combos, as well as the trickiness of the set up. When the holes are created, you grab your balls and start golfing! Just like mini golf each hole is fun to figure out, watch your friends shoot way over par, or try for the hole in one. One of my favorite parts was the ""golf cart"" we got to wheel around with our drinks. After about an hour of mini golf, I felt more than satisfied with mini golfing and ready to reemerge into the daylight.Like mini golf, this isn't something I would want to do every month but I would do it again if a group was going, I like the idea of bringing a work outing. Because it's downstairs, this is best as a cold weather or rainy day activity. If you're curious or just really into golf, stop in for a drink at their bar sometime and check it out. Otherwise if you're bringing a group, it's easy to reserve online. *mini golf clap to round this hole thing out*Have fun!",383,"Milwaukee, WI",1,7,4,8
Nine Below,https://www.yelp.com/biz/nine-below-milwaukee?osq=Bars,4.5,34,"Bars, Mini Golf, Team Building Activities",3,2,Rob S.,4,10/08/2019,"This was a great birthday for me and a small group of friends. Really enjoyed the session and thought it was timed pretty well, and alcohol wasn't expensive either, which I appreciated. I also liked how we took photos for their Facebook and IG profiles. Easy to access, and free for us/free advertising for them. Only reason I give it four stars rather than five is that we had one member of our group have a family member get deathly sick a couple hours before the session and weren't able to remove them from our reservation because ""the system locked it in"". You're telling me you don't have control over your own system? Especially with a couple hours' notice. (Their cancellation policy is 24 hours, by the way.)I understand that people are fickle, and that they could cancel an entire reservation in a moment's notice. But the result instead is that the event organizer, who usually is the one spearheading to come here in lieu of another business, gets left with the tab when someone doesn't show up, meaning I'm not going to go to all the effort to bring people back, knowing the reservation system is so inflexible. So Nine Below loses out on my bringing another group here all because they wouldn't charge me $85 instead of $90. There has to be a better way. This is the same reason I've never tried the axe throwing, because whenever you get a big enough group that the price per head gets reasonable, you always lose a person and pay more than you would going alone. Employee actually said they'd comp me a free game for our missing person, which was a nice gesture at the moment. But they never followed through on it.

I went here on a date and it was an absolute blast. He signed us up for a time on a Friday night and it was completely packed. We got there early to grab a drink and scope out the props for our hole. They have a full bar and so many fun and random props to create your hole. It's a lot of fun to see the creative side of everyone. You have around an hour to design your hole and another hour then to play all of the other holes. My one tidbit on this was I think we could have used a little less time to design and more to play the holes, because we weren't able to finish all of them. Overall, I would definitely come back here. I think I would recommend not to have too large of a group, because that's what makes it take longer for each hole.",177,"Milwaukee, WI",1,3,0,2

The whole place is decorated like a mini put place, which is pretty cool. The concept of this place is to build your own mini put hole (obstacles, paths, etc) and then play a round of mini golf with other holes made by other people. It's usually pretty fun and entertaining, especially given the amount of obstacles and building materials provided. The bar has good prices for drinks too! The only downfall (not caused by Nine Below) is that sometimes groups can make ridiculous obstacles for their hole, which makes it almost impossible to play.

The drinks are cheap, and they have old school N64 to play while you wait for your round to start.

The guy cooking was super friendly and really knows his stuff. All of the meats were simply outstanding. Great smoky flavor, excellent sauces. The fries were super basic bagged frozen which was a bit disappointing. Jalapeño corn bread was served warm but no option for butter and a bit lacking in flavor.

There are tea varieties to suit every palate including a few uncaffeinated options, and they offer some dried fruits and spices to add to your steeping tea.

The server explained to us the 13 different tea blends and recommended tea infusions depending on what we were looking for. I chose the hibiscus plum tea which is tart fruity and very delicious. The tea offering came with a decadent offering of finger sandwiches and sweet pastry. The caviar finger sandwich was to die for and the fruit custard tartlet went very well with the tea. They instructed us on food pairings a d took very good care of us.

Prior to coming into the Blu all guests must wear masks before entering which is great & all employees wore their masks as well. We were told our waitress would come soon but we waited awhile before anyone came & was going to leave. When our waitress finally came she was pleasant but we noticed our waitress was the bartender. We assumed they were short staff because our waitress had our table on top of handling the bar. We had to wait awhile for our waitress to come back to order another drink & told her right away we wanted our check. We were disappointed  since we were celebrating our special day & did not get the service we deserved.

Definitely will not disappoint.-Longer Review Below My friend and I were celebrating her 21st birthday and I wanted to surprise her with an out of state rooftop bar experience. Originally we planned to go to a different bar but at that time they were booked for the next 2 hours. (We were not going to wait that long haha). So we spent 20 minutes driving around trying to find the spot for us. Blu was our last effort before giving up and looking back on it now it was a huge blessing in disguise. As soon as we arrived there was no wait time at all, the hostess notified us that there was one more window seat available for me and my friend. This gave us the perfect view of downtown at night (See Picture). She was super kind, very reassuring and made sure we were comfortable before leaving. The menu was simple and easy to access through scanning the QR code. The food looked so good but we were there for the drinks that day hehe. We ordered a Mango Mojito and the Cheese Board (cheese is a must when in Wisconsin hehe). In honesty, the Cheese Board did take a pretty long time to arrive but honestly me and my friend were too busy enjoying the drinks and the views to care. Did I also mention they have live music, I don't want to spoil it but the nice jazz and piano playing is beyond words better than any place I have heard so far :).The cheese board was literally amazing I don't know what made this taste so good but me and my friend loved every bit of it. The drink? Even better! I highly recommend everyone to get and/or try this if you have not already. The fruity flavor is not super noticeable but neither is the alcohol as well. Its a perfect mix were nothing stands out too much but just enough to taste everything and leave you wanting more. By the end of this the waitress came by and dropped off some free dessert for us. Why you may ask? Well they felt back for taking a bit long with the Cheese Board that they gave us a place of free dessert which has a couple of little small sweet snack as part of it. (I guess this also worked out as a nice birthday dessert for my friend haha). The staff was so kind and considerate, even giving us free dessert when we had no issues about wait time at all. We were seated immediately and had beautiful piano playing through the entire night. The views were stunning and one of a kind. The food and drinks were definitely better than expected. I beg anyone traveling down to Milwaukee to please take a night to stop by Blu's. Highly worth it, Pretty standard price range, and Amazing views once again.

The bartenders were nice and helpful and I absolutely loved the martinis they made for me.

The service was polite and friendly, but it did feel like we were a bit of an afterthought because I would say 3-4 tables that were seated after us got their food before us and we were a party of 2. We weren't in a rush at all, so it ended up being fine, but if I had somewhere to be I definitely would've been late.

SO much crispy bacon pieces and could have used some more ooey gooey mac and cheese, but that was probably better without taking a lactate beforehand. The chips were deliciously crispy! I wish it was paired with an aioli or another sauce, but ketchup/pepper was still good. We also ordered the BBQ pulled pork sandwich which included onion rings and poblano peppers.

We had been told by the wait staff that we could sit anywhere (the restaurant side or the bar side) because it was all the same. We had our room key that had the 25% off of your bill if we dined with them. My husband got a steak with potatoes and broccoli while I ordered the zuppa tuscana. I was served my soup right away. I went to give it back right away claiming I didn't order chili. She quickly responded that it was indeed Zuppa. I explained what zuppa was and a quick Google search would show it is NOTHING like this chili I was served. She claimed that this is the only way she's EVER seen Zuppa made. I highly doubt it. I took 2 bites and it was so salty I could have killed snails with it. I gave it back. It was not charged to our bill after I explained again it was definitely NOT zuppa and it was unedible. If they wanted me to show them REAL zuppa I could go to their kitchen and make it for them. My husband gets his order. It was plain. No seasonings. A rabbit could have put that plate together. It was a slab of steak (I will say it was cooked to the way he wanted it) small potatoes steamed and a broccoli slice that looked slightly grilled on 1 side. No seasonings or anything. It was just cooked, but not presented well at all. For the prices we were paying as well as the kitchen staff they claim to have, it was far from culinary art. If I can make it better at home and I don't have a culinary degree, I'm disappointed. If I go to a nice restaurant, I expect same or better food than what I can prepare myself. HUGE disappointment. Then to top it off. At the end of our dining experience, we go to pay the bill and present our 25% off room key for our bill. We were told by the staff, sorry we can't honor  that because we are the bar not the restaurant. We explained how we were told by their hostess that we could dine on either side and it was the same thing. So sorry, we have different promotions.

I came here with a group of six on a Saturday night, having a reservation for 730. We arrived a little early to fill out the waivers (yes, you have to fill one out for shuffleboard). At first, I was not sure how the experience would go. Our reservation start time was running late, and it was difficult to be served at the bar. But around 745 a staffer found us and explained shuffleboard. The reservation of 90 minutes began and that was definitely enough time! Shuffleboard was really fun and surprisingly challenging. You get you own  drinks from the bar (I hope they add more tap beers) and there are supes cute sitting areas by each shuffleboard lane. I would urge caution with the biscuits and that they can be difficult to stop. I saw a few fly off the lane and hit spectators' feet. Maybe a small installed lip would help to stop them. Towards the back are the axe throwing lanes, which I did not use, but would return to try.

We sat down at the end of the bar, ordered our drinks and began to converse with one another. Our bartender occasionally chatted with us, as did another patron. Shortly after, our bartender left. We were there maybe another 45 minutes, when I noticed that the bar had cleared out, leaving the three of us, one bartender, and two other patrons.As I sat between my husband and our friend, I noticed the female at the other end of the bar hand her purse to the bartender, who put it on the bar back. The bartender then walked towards us, around the bar and went behind a door; the female quickly followed. All I could think to myself was, ""No way. It's not what you think. Nope."" Well, within minutes, we heard the definite sounds of, shall we say, enjoyment? I'm not talking about laughing here, folks!

It's nothing fancy, and basically has high tops with wood stools, but if you have an appreciation for the simplicity and warmth of a neighborhood tavern you'll feel right at home here.

I Closed Wolksi's bumper stickers can be found worldwide.That being said, it's just a bar. There are many other bars in the area that I would rather sit at, but the crowds here can be fun. This place is probably more popular with people because of the nostalgia, the reputation, and the bumper sticker. Much like riding the Cyclone in New York, it is not the best coaster around, but it has history so it draws people. Wolski's has that vibe to me. Parking can be a pain, but there are a few small lots around. The beer menu is average, but you'll find something you like to drink.There is a full bar that can make all of your old fashioned, whiskey, and vodka drinks. They do offer free popcorn, which is nice. It is also a sales trick because it is salty, which makes you thirsty, which causes you to drink more beer. Old school, just like Wolski's.If you are in the mood to visit an old school dive bar in the Milwaukee area with a vintage feel and atmosphere, check out Wolski's.

You can taste a quality in the meat versus going to a lot of other places. I know that we will go back again to try their other burgers.  You can really taste the freshness and their burgers.

I was hungry. This restaurant is inside my layover hotel, and I was overcome by the convenience of eating here before it was time to meet up with my first officer and go fly. Seating myself at the bar, there were only 2 other people in the entire restaurant. This made me apprehensive, but the server told me they had only been open post-COVID for 2 days. The entire kitchen staff was new, and so was the menu. Moreover, it was his first day back, and he hadn't tried any of the food. Uh, oh. I'm the experiment.Here we go!I decided to order the roasted chicken dish that included roasted asparagus, pearl onions, and roasted potatoes. I got my food, and I was actually impressed by the presentation. Remember that this is at the Hilton Garden Inn. It ain't the Ritz-Carlton. My chicken had a nicely seasoned garlic sauce on it, and everything was succulent. I could feel myself eating fast, but I didn't bother to slow down. Instead, I started eyeballing the chicken wings the couple across from me had. I noticed they were eating fast, too! Chicken wings seemed like the perfect to-go choice for an inflight snack. I got mine with the 7 (or was it 10?) dry spice, with a side of sauce.  I had the sever run my check, so I could checkout after I ate. The chicken wings were ready and boxed right after I ate. Our limo driver to the airport rolled up right after I checked out. The timing of everything was surreal. I got in the car and decided to taste a wing. Bad idea. The chicken was so good that I finished it before we got to the airport. Hopefully I didn't get chicken grease on my uniform. A greasy captain is NOT a good look. Mission accomplished because I ate everything and my clothes were spotless. My fingers? Not so much, but my supply of hand sanitizer fixed that.Lesson learned? ""The Social"" has great food! I can't wait for my next Milwaukee layover to further explore the menu. Also, I underestimated this place because it was in a Hilton Garden Inn. My mistake. For what I paid, the food was a bargain.

Only in Milwaukee will you find a dive bar that's basically falling apart, smack-freaking-dab in the middle of downtown/Westown. Only in Milwaukee can you attend a fancy-pants convention at the WI Center or a museum fundraiser, then walk directly across the street, order a cheap beer under glaringly bright lights next to a seasoned/grizzled alcoholic on one side and a gaggle of Marquette students on the other. There will be no music unless you front for it on the internet jukebox. (You will enjoy the local news otherwise.)The women's bathroom sink is held in place by errant pieces of plywood.

It was close to my apartment, they drinks were on the house and the DJs were usually pretty good.Flash forward about 20 years and a friend asked if I wanted yo revisit them for a drink or two. We entered and the place has not changed in 20 years. We had a couple drinks, and they were good and reasonably affordable.Then we started watching the diners around us. In all those years we'd never eaten at Victor's or really noted that they served food.We decided to order a fish fry dinner to share. They charged us a couple extra dollars for splitting, but it was well worth it and we had enough easily to feed two with leftovers.The fish was crunchy and well battered. The loaf of bread they serve it with was plentiful and warm. The hash brown casserole was yummy and decadent. We even liked the coleslaw, which was creamy and not overly sweet.Service was a little indifferent. We ate at the bar and they piled dirty glassware in front of us the whole time we were there, which was not pleasant. But the staff was nice.I will definitely eat there again.",209,"Milwaukee, WI",1,2,0,0

I've been wanting to try their fish fry forever so we finally did! We ordered the all you can eat cod fish fry with cheesy potatoes (per the recommendation of many Yelpers). So here's the thing, you get the large loaf of buttery bread with extra butter, but you know if you eat too much of it you won't have room for the rest of the meal. So I'd suggest pacing yourself on the bread, they will give you a plastic bag and tie to take it home for later. The plate comes out and the fish pieces are huge, you get 3 for $13.95. Included is also the side (cheesy potatoes), coleslaw and tarter sauce. I was only able to eat one piece and had part of the potatoes, but honestly when I looked there were some huge air pockets in between the batter and fish. So if you took some of that off, you could probably eat all three pieces. And then you can get more if you can stuff it all in!I liked the cheesy potatoes, they had lots of cheese and an onion flavor. But ours were a little bit too crispy on the top. I wouldn't say they're the greatest thing ever but they were tasty. Almost a bit too salty for me. They were a little better the next day with a fried egg on top.I think for the price and all the food you get or could get (all you can eat) this is a great deal for a fish fry. I almost thought my fish was too crispy, while my bf thought his wasn't crispy enough. The fish was good but isn't standing out as my favorite. It did however crisp up nicely in the air fryer the next day. Our server was nice, but she seemed a bit stressed and mentioned that she was super busy a couple of times. We get it, no big deal. Other than the food, this place is a real gem for watching all sorts of people, young and old. After dinner the dance floor opens up but we didn't stay that long. The decor is dated but that's part of the charm. It's a fun place to check out on a Friday or Saturday night.",410,"Milwaukee, WI",1,0,0,2

It's been a Milwaukee institution for generations, and it is a bit like a living museum of the 1970s. The decor feels like a fever dream of a disco, strip club, and casino.  But, even if the style may feel a bit dated, you'll find Victor's very clean (other than the bathrooms) and welcoming. And, despite the fact it looks like a dance club, the place has some very fine food. The Friday fish fry (cod or perch) is plentiful, delicious and priced right. On our recent visit, each serving was enough for dinner and lunch the next day. You get a choice of potatoes, including a loaded baked potato and a heaping portion of cheesy hash browns that will take a day off your life (and be worth it.) If you come for dinner, chances are you'll be treated to a soundtrack of Bread, Gloria Gaynor, 10cc, Fleetwood Mac, and other retro Boomer favorites. After dinner, the volume goes up, the beats get faster and louder, the music turns more contemporary, and the crowd starts dancing. You'll find Victor's a fun, multi-generational place for drinking and fun, provided you can check your judgments at the door.Victor's is also a place to come and watch sports. While not a sports bar, you'll find plenty of TVs showing games around its enormous bar. On Sundays, it has a buffet and drink specials for Packer games. Some may find Victor's a curiosity, and perhaps it is, but I'm glad there are places that time leaves untouched. I hope Victor's stays the way it is for many years.

The sides were delicious, portions huge, and the warm buttered bread and loaded hash browns were amazing! I still dream about the deliciousness of the bread. Im not a fish eater and was hoping for maybe a chicken dish or even an appetizer...but beware non fish eaters...they do not have options on Fridays. I had looked at the menu ahead of time, but nowhere did it mention that they didn't serve their normal menu on Fridays. They only served a fish fry specific menu when we went on Friday...and when I asked about a non-fish option I was told that they didn't have anything other than a seafood bisque. The only appetizer they had on the menu was fries. While I'm not a fish person, my boyfriend loved the fish fry and thought it was one of the best in Milwaukee. I would've given them a four, but due to the menu constraints and the fact that the tables weren't very clean, particularly considering the current state of things...that was a bit disappointing, so I dropped it.",194,"Milwaukee, WI",1,0,0,0

We were not only pleased, but we were blown away! My spouse loves IPAs and he was thrilled at the hop-forward nature of many of the beers. His favorite of the IPA option was the Heavenly Haze. He loved how it was hop forward, while also being juicy and flavorful. He looks forward to continuing to try more varieties in future visits.I've tried a variety of different beers during our visits, but some of my favorites include the Ice Bear (Baltic porter) and Thaison (Thai spice saison). Both are creative and rich in flavors. But my favorite was the Frog Weiss, the raspberry fruited sour. The flavor was bright, crisp, and distinct without being overly sweet. I also look forward to trying many more in the future.The staff are great, health and safety rules are followed enabling employees and customers to both be safe, and space is wide open for spreading out, both inside and outside. Chic, new, and ever expanding, it is a great place to come with a group or for some one-on-one time!There is a food truck on site, but you can also bring food from outside.

The venue is pretty cool and they had a lot of tables and lights set up outside. I am not a huge fan of a large variety of beers and I did not see many options on their tasting menu that I was interested in trying that were included in the flight. I was intrigued with trying their Barrel aged options but in the included flight, you had to pay an upcharge for one of these which was the exact cost of a 4 oz sample, so no reason to use it in our flight. One of the main beers on their regular menu (Java Blanca) that I wanted to try when I knew we were coming here was also out- I tried the Acres Edge, White the Clans, Oktoberfest, and Cold Fusion- the beers were fine but I would not order any of them again. We ended up leaving after the tasting since we didn't want to order anything larger than our samples. The actual brewery area is cool and it is nice that they let you bring in your own food as well!

Dark wood, chill venue with some surprising food. I started with their house soup which tasted like spicy queso dip with chunks of tender, moist chicken. Seriously I felt like I should've had tortilla chips rather than the crusty dinner roll (which would've been amazing with some good butter but was still tasty dipped in the soup).The cheese curds. Dear god. They were like stringy clouds of salty deliciousness. They melted in your mouth with the delicate light batter and gooey curd. Puffs of cheese heaven. Extra bonus points for not being crazy salty like a lot of curds get due to salty batter. My cousin had the fish and chips which was textbook perfect. The same light batter on tender, flaky cod and served on thick and potatoey steak fries - sorry, chips. It came with a good balanced tartar sauce and okay coleslaw (not much flavor, definitely needed vinegar)I got the pan fried walleye which was my only real complaint about the meal. It was cooked a bit too hot because the fish was moist and tender but the outside had several spots of almost burnt breading that overpowered the fish with an acrid, sour taste. I still ate almost all my fish after scraping off the breading, so meal salvaged. The potato pancake was dense and cooked well, crispy outside but tender inside and a lot of thyme for a nice earthy flavor. Potato pancakes are the only time you'll see me put apples on a potato.

Less no due to covid restrictions and more (I assume) when restrictions are lifted. There also appears to be an upstairs but we didn't venture there and opted to sit at the bar.

It also has tomatoes in it, although the menu and bartender said it didn't. It was good enough to pick out the onions and eat the entire wrap. The fries are steak fries, which were seasoned appropriately. Not my favorite style of fries but solid. My daughter and I ordered the Baked Tomato. The description reads, ""Premium house-made, creamy tomato soup topped with a grilled cheese sandwich and locally sourced fresh mozzarella and cheddar, baked into a dish.""  We weren't entirely sure what to expect but were very pleased with our meal. The soup is a thick soup making it easy for the grilled cheese to sit on top. By baking the dish, the cheese had a beautiful crust to it. Perfect if you looking for a light soup and salad option.

I checked my Yelp bookmarks and a few items at Oak Barrel Public House looked good, so I went with them. I ordered whiskey battered cheese curds, Cajun dry rub wings, and smash burger with American cheese and lettuce, and upcharged the side for the burger to the bier cheese mac and cheese.The curds were good, but a little greasy and I didn't taste the whiskey at all. You do get a lot, though. The wings had plenty of Cajun flavor, but the flats had a noticeable amount of excess fat compared to wings I've had elsewhere and the rub at no heat to it. Eight wings for $15 is steep.When I ordered the smash burger I asked for American cheese. I didn't know they don't have American cheese until after my burger arrived with cheddar on it and the waitress never bothered to say anything when I ordered, otherwise I would have gotten muenster. It also didn't help that the burger wasn't seasoned at all.The mac and cheese was fine and certainly both hot and cheesy. I didn't love the flavor of the bier cheese, but I can't fault those that do.I was ready to give Oak Barrel a 3 out of 5 based on me being a little disappointed by the food but impressed with how quickly it came out and the service overall. Then I saw that I was charged a fee for paying with a credit card. How asinine. If you don't want people to pay with a card, make your business cash only. If you want to accept cards, raise your prices and fold the fee into them. No other restaurant I can think of does this and it's BS that you're cheap enough to charge customers an additional fee.

It certainly wasn't enough of a portion size to easily share with five people, but hey free food is free food! It definitely had that bacony flavor too it that everyone enjoyed. For a main, I went with the caprese wrap. It was A-OK but I don't think I'd need to order it again. Pretty heavy on the romaine, and light on the mozz cheese, but all in all it has good flavoring and spice. I added chicken as well, which I definitely recommend as it helped add a little more substance.

It soon became clear we were the only ones watching the fight, and were sitting quite a distance from everyone else, toward the back. At a crucial point in the match, the bar tender (who was standoffish and unhelpful to that point) went out of his way to change ONLY our TV to the news cycle (truly at the climax of the match). I looked around and every single other TV was still on the fight except for ours. I remind you, we were the only ones in this bar who remotely cared to watch it. I politely walked over to the other side of the room to a TV to finish the fight and the bartender watched me do it - never once offering to change it back. The circumstance was obviously intentional, even if it sounds petty. There were passive aggressive remarks and a VERY unwelcoming attitude from almost everyone inside.

The dart board was pretty old and had some wear and tear on it. Other than that everything was at least ok.

A few things that I appreciated about the Landmark: 1) friendly and prompt service without being smothering. When it's quiet, sometimes bartenders get overly chatty. Sometimes I'm okay with that, but at 830 pm on a Tuesday after a 14 hour day, this is not the time. She gave me my space but was always ready if I needed something. 2) The beer selection is good. I was happy to see several local options that weren't just the big brewery usual suspects, and the prices were affordable. (After several business trips on the coasts, it was great to see affordable drinks again.) 3) The food was delicious.

The decor inside is really intricate too with the old pictures and mirrors, the great stove, and awesome looking bar. Love the intimacy of the tables and the wire back chairs. The cons: there sound inside carries, so everyone's conversations seem amplified and it was super loud. Based on the previous reviews I read I expected the perch fry to be awesome and it fell way short. It's possible that the chef could have had an off night with the fish because everything else we ordered was pretty good. But the fish was way over fried, very dry, and not anything I was interested in finishing. I know this place is a bar and to expect bar quality, but I've had some pretty great perch fries at other bars and this really wasn't what I was expecting. The potato pancakes were really good. Our cheese nuggets (cheese curds!) appetizer were fine. The walleye dinner was fine. I'd definitely give this place another chance and look forward to writing another review for here. I mean, this place has been open since 1850- if it was really bad it wouldn't have stayed open this long, right?",263,"Milwaukee, WI",1,2,0,1

The lighting and colors are brighter and warmer, at least they were on my visit when the sun was still out, well it was cloudy but not night time. You know what I mean. The tables are new with and the bar has that ""new bar smell"" from the new wood and construction. I was also told the entire roof had to be torn off and replaced.A new keyboard is located on the south wall in the center instead of the southeast corner of the old piano. The drink list offers a handful of drafts, bottles, and wines, as well as a fairly healthy list of spirits. Prices seem in line and reasonable.

There is only 25 or so seats in the entire place, but each one is occupied by the most individual of characters. Regulars have commitments measured in decades, and the decor has not changed since their inaugural visit.The bar and it's furnishings hail from the 1950's.  The mirrors and wood paneling from the 1970's and the classic cocktails from somewhere in between.And the cast of performers each have their niche too.  Jerry is the resident Sinatra-esque crooner.  Danny is the Irishman with a full repertoire of requisite Celtic tunes and Jose is well verse in the Latin love song genre.  With enough encouragement, Angelo, the Proprietor, may be persuaded to join in the folly with one of his sentimental favorites. This, my friends, it a night at Angelo's.  A night so epically original that it inspired a local filmmaker to create a short film to document just that.  So as I render myself speechless on the magic of Angelo's I implore you to check it out for yourself, as some things just have to be seen to be believed!",227,"Milwaukee, WI",1,7,2,6

Needless to say, my experience was disappointing which was a bummer. I am not a quitter though and I think I will give it another try in the future and maybe bring some friends that would be a bit more adventurous. Observations: 1. Average age was around 50. Which doesn't usually bother me because I am a bit of an old soul, however oddly I did feel a bit out of place. 2. It smelled very musky and was much smaller and intimate than i expected. 3. Everyone in the bar got up and sang some fancy show tune I didn't recognize, made me feel like I needed to do the same (and then embarrass myself because I have the voice of a 3yr old child) 4. We sat next to a really sad older guy at the bar that was obsessed with telling us his life story. I think this was one of the main reasons I didn't have the best time is because he completely trumped our experience. (not in a good way) 5. Cash bar :(6.

I think yes!We've been to Eagle Park plenty of times over the last few years, as we live within walking distance, but until now I've never ordered a flight. *Lightbulb* because what a great idea that is! The sun (and warmth) finally came out so we went for a walk bringing along our stroller, which was easy to park on this outdoor patio. Because the brewery is tucked up into a neighborhood, the patio is fairly quiet, plenty spacious, and doesn't have traffic flying by which is nice. Lots of big, round picnic tables to choose from that sit right in the sunshine. The table next to us was sipping on beer flights, which influenced me to get one. My husband went in to grab our drinks, so he chose the selections for me, doing a great job. I had (1) the Dragonfruit Slush - a sour ale made with dragonfruit purée, and yes it's as refreshing as it sounds, (2) the Hef, aka Hefeweizen, which was my least fave but still enjoyable, and (3) the Tiki Dave's Painkiller - this sour ale has notes for pineapple, orange, nutmeg, and coconut with a higher ABV for sure.

I am not a beer drinker. Give me anything else- a cocktail, some vodka, even a tiny little bottle of Fireball Whisky sneaked into a purse- and I'll have it happily, but for some reason, my tastebuds had to draw the line at beer. I've been very hard-pressed to find a beer that I like because the traditional offerings at most breweries aren't to my taste- thankfully, there is Eagle Park, offering a wide array of innovative beers and hard seltzers that even I can enjoy. After trooping through a good many breweries in this city, I am happy to declare Eagle Park my favorite brewery that I've tried so far. Milwaukee natives, you are welcome to turn your nose up at me, but can I just say how gratifying it is to come to Eagle Park and be able to actually enjoy a beer as the Real Wisconsonites do? Impostor syndrome, cured- Eagle Park is better than therapy. (but shh, don't tell my therapist)Located just off the Milwaukee River near Brady, the venue has both an outdoor, dog-friendly patio and plentiful indoor seating for the chillier winter months. It also has its own parking lot, making a visit a little too convenient for my attempts at watching my weight. I don't know how things operated pre-COVID, but the current protocol is to seat yourself, scan the menu via QR code on each table, and complete your entire order on your phone. You can also go up to order drinks at the bar. The beverage menu is overwhelming in the best way- so many options and unique ideas, all offered as full and half pours as well as to-go packages. They also offer flights. This menu changes quite regularly, so I'm always excited to see what's new and cool to try. While the beers are excellent, my absolute favorite drinks are the smoothie-style hard seltzers, which are always unbelievably delicious. I think that they could also be a good option for those who don't usually enjoy alcohol and alcohol-lovers alike. Most recently, I tried the dragonfruit, orange, and mango hard smoothie, which was great! I wish I had the foresight to write down all the drinks I've tried here, but alas...in any case, I would recommend trying the more unique options while you are here. While the food at Eagle Park isn't my favorite of the brewery foods out there, it is always pretty good, with generous portions and fair pricing [$10-15]. The fried chicken sandwich is great, and who doesn't love thighs- sorry, this is supposed to be a family-friendly review? Their Friday fish fry is pretty solid too- definitely the best-seasoned fish fry I've had around. As a fry aficionado, I can safely say their fries are the stuff of dreams. The curds and nachos...not so much; I'd sooner recommend the parmesan fries as an appetizer. The curds are okay, not my preferred kind, and the nachos are simply too gourmet and gentrified for a food that's meant to be guilt-inducingly delicious. I hope that one day they'll bring back their duck confit burger...now that, that was a marvel. I don't like beer or burgers, but somehow Eagle Park has managed to wow me with both. My partner has tried and enjoyed the Wisconsin classic burger; combined with a beer flight, this led him to proclaim Eagle Park to be the perfect brewery. My friends and I will certainly be frequent visitors to Eagle Park for post-exam commiseration and casual nights out, and I can't wait to see what new offerings pop up on their menu. Eagle Park will undoubtedly continue to delight and entertain!",644,"Wauwatosa, WI",0,0,0,1

The belle of the ball at Eagle Park  was for sure the cheese curds though. It was my first Wisconsin cheese curd experience and did not disappoint. They were the best out of many subsequent curds I tried. The perfect crispy, cheesy, flavorful, and not too oily experience I was looking for. And to top it off the staff was super nice.

Im unsure about the identity of the space. Its a dark lit intimate space with hip and upscale style seating and couches. The TV's are everywhere which is a good thing. Is it a bar? A dive? A hookah spot? Or a nightclub? They played music videos or mainly hip hop and some pop of like 4 or 5 years ago. So a lot of hip hop but the vibe was more like south side dive bar.The Interior is on point but this adds to the confusion. We ordered a hookah for 20 bucks which is typically the standard price and two drinks. The tab was reasonable. We were not able to use our groupon because it was after 9pm this I did not know. Ok well we had to adapt.Besides our table, only the bartender was smoking a hookah. This was an issue. You cant have hookah option and no one smoke it! The music was not current at all. The people at the bar were playing Yahtzee.... lol Yahtzee! Some other group was shooting darts. We needed some coals for the hookah. The bartender came from behind the bar and to gather the hookah and take it to light the coals in the back. Big issue! Take a note from Casablanca and light the coals in the back and get a hookah bowl for the coals and bring them out to the table. This takes to long to take the hookah, light the coals and bring it back to the customer.I wasnt able to use my groupon, so I will be back to cash that in. After that I wont go back unless changes are made. On a weekend night at 10pm people were playing Yahtzee as a owner you have to look at that and make changes. They should add special nights to attract a more diverse crowd (no people of color on this night) and more people, it is to big of a space to be so empty.",337,"Milwaukee, WI",1,4,2,0

A quick Yelp search led me to Von Trier. 20 minutes and an Uber ride later, we were in the East Side neighborhood and we were dropped in front of the brick building. We made our way inside with no reservation and found seating in the corner of the restaurant.The bar has an old 70's Bierstube feel and I love the German beer steins lining the bar wall. It had a very relaxed and local vibe to it.  There's also an outdoor patio in the back if you want to dine al fresco.The history of the bar, especially the story behind its former owner, was interesting and tragic at the same time. Despite the misfortune, it's nice to know Von Trier exists to service the public and I'm hoping this local gem sticks around for another 50 years.The menu is not extensive but they have your traditional German offerings with a modern spin. My husband ordered the Jagerschnitzel with Spaetzle and I got the grilled Trout dish with roasted asparagus and cucumber. Our mains were excellent. In fact everything was excellent!

Von Trier will always have a special place in my heart. It was here that I drank my first-ever import beer, a Hacker Pschorr Weiss, upon reaching drinking age many years ago. (The place opened in 1978.) I've been coming back ever since to enjoy the old-school German decor, terrific beer selection, and cozy outdoor patio. While the bar has been open for over 40 years, food is a relatively new addition to the Von Trier experience. The kitchen opened late in 2019, and based on our February 2020 experience, it needs a bit of attention. Some of our food was good--I thought The Von Trier burger was above average--but others in our party weren't quite as happy with their selections (a seafood special and a sausage entree were only okay, according to my friends.)  The real problem was that the service was a bit iffy, as if the service crew hasn't realized the difference between service at a bar versus service at a restaurant. We had an appetizer delivered (good but not great cheese curds) without plates or utensils.  Then, when the entrees were delivered, the server couldn't identify anything. She held each up and stared at it, trying to diagnose what was on the plate in order to get it delivered to the right person. (She got it wrong, which the members of my party realized after biting into their sandwiches.) I will remain a loyal fan of Von Trier's German bar, Biergarten, and Bier Stube, but I won't be in a hurry to come back for dinner. There are better options in the neighborhood, in my opinion. (I feel bad giving Von Trier just four stars, because four months ago it would've been a five-star bar, but if you're going to offer food, you have to get the front and back of house right, and it feels like Von Trier is still working on that--so, four stars, it is!)",359,"Milwaukee, WI",1,2,0,1

The place has a dedicated parking lot which is nice but street parking was plentiful at lunch time. As I walked up a sign in front says Sunday $3.50 Bloody Mary with a Miller light chaser so I guess I'm having the Sunday special now because when in Rome. The place is definitely unique with antiques on the walls and ceilings from a stretcher, bikes pedal cars etc. the bar has a long bar with a pool table and games on the upper level. I ordered the Bloody Mary spicy but Pabst was an option for the chaser so since it's a former Milwaukee beer I chose that over Miller light. The Bloody Mary was as expected nothing special and Pabst is Pabst so your typical neighborhood bar drinks.The menu is small and cheap so I wasn't expecting much but I ordered the $3.50 cheeseburger that comes with pickles or onions, raw or fried so I chose raw. I saw what looked to be a hand formed patty come out of a zip lock bag, the pizza oven was opened up and a sheet of foil was inserted and my burger went in, these crazy mofo's are making cheeseburgers in a pizza oven. You get ketchup and mustard set next to you for when your burger is done. There is a hot pot next to the pizza oven with probably the soup or chili of the day.It's a very basic cheeseburger on a generic white bun with raw onions and generic razor thin pickle slices. The cheeseburger was actually good because it was a fresh hand formed patty that was juicy with a nice beef flavor I thought. It's not super huge so if you have a bigger appetite than order 2 or get the soup or chili.This was a pretty reasonable for the experience of a new place with drinks and a small lunch with the $3.50 cheeseburger, 3.50 Bloody Mary with a glass of Pabst and $3.00 tip which = $10.

The burgers were served with hamburger pickles on the side. The patties were prepared in a somewhat intriguing gadget on the counter that looked similar to a pizza oven.

Will you feel threatened? Unwelcome? Out of place? I've experienced all of these at one time or another -- sometimes all at one time. (I'm looking at you, up north Wisconsin bar next to the Bad River Tribe of Chippewa Indians reservation. I walked in to pick up a six'er in the midst of the Wisconsin spear fishing conflict in the late 80s -- a conflict in which I had no opinion or care. I was lucky to leave that bar not only with my 6-pack, but without a pool cue uncomfortably positioned as a permanent part of my anatomy!)Mamie's is the kind of place that won't give you any of those feelings. In fact, it's one of the most welcoming, melting pot bars I know of in the city of Milwaukee.For years I was curious about this classic looking lounge at 33rd and National. I made my first visit on a Friday night as Mamie's was hosting their annual Halloween costume contest. My wife and I, sans costume, took only a few steps into Mamie's before a kind fellow dressed as a mobster handed us a couple of chocolate kisses.  A few minutes later, a Madam Marie Laveau lookalike placed strands of beads around our necks.As we glanced around the joint, we couldn't help but notice the great mix of ethnicities libating together -- African Americans, Mexican Americans and southside Milwaukee, Joe 6-pack Americans. All enjoying a festive Friday night and the live blues and jazz provided by Chanel le Meaux and the Dapper Cads.Mamie's is a great place to take in live blues music. Friday nights are reserved for the pros, and Tuesday night is for the others (open jam night; if you can play, you can join!). If you're lucky enough to visit on a night when Chanel le Meaux is performing, you're in for a real treat. She's a total pro.I can't say that every Friday night at Mamie's will be as fun and as welcoming as my first visit, but even if it is not, I will look forward to future visits. I'll definitely be checking out the Open Jam on Tuesdays.

The patio is broken up into several seating areas separated by small plantings that create nicely appointed human scaled spaces. Visually, this space is anchored by a couple tear drop shaped bamboo chairs hung from an overhang connected to the main building.The main building is home to the largest of three indoor spaces and includes a near 40Ft long glazed wooden bar with a continuation of wooden trusses overhead and dark subway tile as a backdrop. They offer a great selection (20+?) of beers & adult beverages on tap.Booths & tables with oversized oak barrels to sit within, provide a backdrop similarly seen in many old brewery storage tunnels used to keep beers cold back in the day.The smaller building is across from the main building & split up into two rooms. The first is a retail / tasting room located towards the front of the property & has a massive selection of bottled & canned beers / cocktails / wines offered to go. The second room is towards the back of the property adjacent to the rear patio and is a perfect escape for a private venue.There is an open courtyard towards the front of Draft & Vessel that provides great outdoor seating and a perfect perch for people watching as folks walk to & from the Village.They don't offer food but did design a ramp that provides space enough for a food truck to roll up & into the open courtyard.

We were looking for a space to host our rehearsal dinner the night before. Baseball is a mutual interest of ours, and it was a recurring theme throughout our wedding. Broken Bat is one of our favorite breweries, so we reached out to them to see if we could host our event there. With our group size, the brewery wasn't a good fit, but we were told that they were in the early stages of building an upstairs space. The owner said he would check back in with us at a later date to see if we were still in need of a place.We reconnected later and were told great news! The upstairs, Lumber Room, was on track to finish up by spring of 22. That made our event the first to be held there. Everyone we spoke with was lovely. Celina made this entire experience easy for us and answered all of our questions in a timely manner. With us being the first party in their new space, they worked with us on time, cost, and group size. We did receive an email a couple weeks before saying the elevator was not on schedule to be finished by our event. Luckily, this didn't affect anyone in our party, so nothing changed for us.The Lumber Room is terrific! It is extremely spacious, with plenty of tables and chairs. There was plenty of room after our 50 guests. The woodwork is beautiful and it's a cool area. We got catering from Glorioso's and the staff helped to set everything up. The bartenders were attentive and helpful to people making decisions about what beers to drink. We had plenty of space to mingle, eat, and do a wedding party run-through.

Had a great meal and then got hit with a hidden charge of $9. They called it a ""service fee"", saying this will help pay server's salary, but it's not a tip, that's different. Im not kidding about this. WE, the customer, have taken on payroll for this establishment.  Funny, I thought the $18 for eggs Benedict or the $15 for French toast already does that?  Why not just charge what you think you need to for the food, instead of making up some commie nonsense? So, basically it costs $19.50 for French toast and 22.50 for eggs Benedict, if you remove this imaginary progressive fee.  It's a scam.  This reminded me of the episode of hell's kitchen, the one that is widely considered the worst owners episode,  where the owners would take their server's tips. Basically confiscate them.  It's just like that except instead of jacking the server's tips they let them keep em, and jack it from you and make you tip twice to stuff their pockets. I have really expensive health insurance, I should get 20% off my meal.  Only some kind of progressive collectivist could up with such a deluded scam.  Which is odd because its like capitalism and greed overdosed.  I feel bad for the severs too. She was nice and did good,but when she went to hand the check she had to mention this disclamier that the service fee isn't the tip!how awkward. It's like a foem of soft form of begging they make them do and they work hard.    TLDR: They charge a $9 service fee that is basically tipping the house on top of pricey food (which was really good).  Still a 1 for the schemes and being deluded.",295,"McHenry, IL",0,1,0,0

The drinks were tasty, not particularly dressed up, like some MKE spots, but had some cute lemon and lime wedges. The food was tasty, especially the crab cake bennies.

But on top of that, it was explained that that was not accounting for tip. Maybe the server just didn't explain it in a way that made sense to me?

We finally had a free weekend to grab brunch with some friends and this was immediately my recommendation. It totally met all expectations!I made sure to book in for a rez ahead of time, which was easy to do via their website. The four of us were set to come in on Saturday at 12:30pm. NOTE: they do close at 2pm on the weekends, and reopen at 5pm for dinner. I didn't realize this prior to going, so we kind of accidentally overstayed our welcome. Staff wasn't pushy though!The atmosphere here is really nice - very open with big windows letting daylight shine throughout, plants all over, and modern/elegant decor. We were sat at a comfortable hightop and felt spread far enough apart from other tables. They also have glass dividers as an added safety precaution. Beermosas (Spotted Cow + OJ) were enjoyed by all to start. Three of us ordered the Monte Cristo sandwich and all agreed how damn good it was. A lovely, melty mix of turkey, ham and swiss sat between some kind of deep-fried breading. The bread isn't specified on the menu so just know this it what ya get! Though it was delicious, it also made it super filling so I could barely eat half the sandwich. I was also a big fan of the side dipping sauces that came with: a yummy citrus jam and spicy/sweet mustard of some kind. My husband also had all good things to say about the classic burger he had.Other things to know: the staff here is really friendly, service is quick, and parking isn't ideal (it never is in Third Ward, especially on the weekend, so just plan for that).",308,"Milwaukee, WI",1,7,2,7

Google maps had a hard time figuring out where the place was, but I was able to get there by walking. The tables are nicely space and they have large plastic dividers between low-tops for covid precautions. You are given a container of water for the table which I always appreciate to keep your glass full. I started with a coffee (they serve Anodyne) and a bloody mary. I thought the bloody was small, and just garnishing with one olive on a stick was chinsey in my opinion. The flavor was good, but the quality just wasn't up to what I expected. The table started by ordering the monkey bread ($7) for a starter. This was the tiniest monkey bread serving I have every seen - more for one/two people. It was pretty dry a well, I wouldn't order that again. For entrees I ordered Fried Bologna Sandwich ($9) which comes with fries, side salad or cole slaw; since it was brunch I asked if I could sub the seasoned hash browns. She was able to do it for me (upcharge) and I wish I would have just gone with the fries - the browns were soggy and underseasoned. The bologna onion bun was awesome and fluffy, I wish the bologna were cut thicker, it was extremely thin, but the flavor with the pickled onions and the cheese sauce was awesome. We also ordered the Beyond Fabulous Person ($16!!!!) which was their standard, eggs, meat, toast, and hash brown combo. Also it's described as a sausage patty, this was more like a meatball - very very dense. The Chicken and Waffle ($16 and an addition $5!!!! for a bowl off sausage gravy) was good. The chicken was fried nicely and the expensive gravy was good too. Small serving of the gravy so we had to dump another $5 into enough to cover the dish ($10 worth of gravy?!)Lastly we all were tempted by the banana foster waffle ($14), so we ordered that for everyone to try. It was delicious and topped with a nice hard clump of vanilla ice cream so it didn't melt too quickly. Overall I think the food was good and had some unique options, but the prices were astronomical for the food.

We asked if we could push the tables together and she said no. There were no other tables were we were so no other people other than our group, we weren't given a reason, just told no. When she came back to get our drink order she said ""I'm not moving them and I'm gonna say I didn't see anything so you do whatever"", still don't really understand what the big deal is but we did move the tables. Camino is small and if you sit at the bar you can see them make cooking on the flat top. It's a really coolatmosphere and while we enjoyed our lunch experience, I feel like dinner in a weekend would be pretty crowded. That would be okay though because they have a great beer menu.The menu is small but definitely adequate, if you can't find something you like, it's probably because you enjoy chain restaurants and don't appreciate something different.  We were told the crispy Brussels sprouts were a must try and we weren't disappointed, everyone got them for a side and they were amazing. I had the roasted beet salad and added the panko chicken. I have never raves about a salad before but this is rave worthy.  I was expecting a few pieces of chicken but it's a full breast, perfectly cooked and so flavorful. Along with fresh greens and beets, there is Gorgonzola and a really great dressing. It was easily enough for two people but I ate the whole thing because it was so damn good. In the end, our waitress turned out to be really nice and took good care of us.

Camino has done a good job with COVID protocols providing social distancing for customers. We went on a Monday for their $5 dollar burger deal which is a cheeseburger ala carte with melted cheese and delicious fried onions. Burger is cooked to order so they are fresh. Among the more solid burgers in the city, especially for 5 dollars on Monday. Bun was buttered with a grilled finish, and the melted cheese oozed off the burger. I also got a size of cheese curds which are among the best in the city. Cheese is from Clock Shadow Creamery with a Russian dressing to dip it with.Service provided was attentive and very solid.

I've heard so many good things about this place so I was really excited to go here. Overall I had a below average experience. The first thing that caught me off guard coming to Camino was the lack of effort to social distancing. Masks are required when inside, but other than that it seemed like they were doing the bare minimum for Covid-19. Luckily I came during the week day so there weren't too many people and they did have outdoor seating which was nice. The food was Ok and pricey. I got a burger and crispy brussels for a side. The burger was actually pretty decent but the crispy brussels were very disappointing. I'm pretty sure they completely burnt my crispy brussels because it tasted like I was just eating bunt bits. I could not taste any flavor of the brussels! It was so bad I could only take 2 bites of it before I had to quit. The only thing I actually enjoyed was the decent amount of choices for drinks, but in the end it didn't make up for the crispy brussels.  I personally with good conscience can not recommend Camino as of right now. They might be slacking on their food preparation because of Covid-19 so I'll give them some leniency.

During my first time in Milwaukee, I parked my car across the street from the nearby Starbucks, and proceeded to walk down Brady Street to beer crawl. For those first timers in Milwaukee like myself, the Nomad World Pub is one of those venues that you have to stop into first. The confines are a bit small, but okay. Large bar area with plenty of drink & craft beer choices. Great place to watch a game as well, even if you aren't a Packers fan. The IPAs were unbelievably hoppy, yet I would expect no less while in Milwaukee. The bartenders are very laid back and personable. The female bartender that served me (35ish, slender blonde) even recommended other places to pop into while walking on Brady Street. I noted that the bar doesn't serve food. If they do, its usually just snacks. Yet I don't see the reason for it when there are quite a few choices with regard to hot dogs and the like within walking distance. One cool thing that this bar did for me is while keeping my tab open, I walked to another venue to get a couple of hot dogs & fries. I tend to believe that they normally don't do this, yet I felt so comfortable with them that in turn, they felt comfortable with me to return & pay my tab. Of course, it also helps that I left my car keys there as insurance. LOL. Pretty cool place, and close to everything else. Outdoor seating is available, yet very limited.",262,"Fort Worth, TX",0,2,3,1

Some pieces have strong social commentary, and some are just pretty to look at.

The drinks are overpriced ($29 for one glass of champagne + one vodka white claw) but, you aren't coming here just for a drink but for an experience so I will let the steep price tags slide.

I went sort of begrudgingly, but wow ... I think I enjoyed it almost more than she did! The establishment itself just screams JAZZ! It's dark and cozy and all the things you would expect a jazz club to be, albeit not smoky, thankfully, due to our friendly WI no-smoking laws.  The Christmas decor just added to the ambiance w/ tasteful lights and greenery.  In addition to the bar towards the front, there was table service.  A thick drink menu awaited us there that included some fun, seasonal specials.  The music itself didn't disappoint.  It was what we were all there for, and was peppered with appropriately winter/Christmas-themed poetry and a little dry humor from the trio performing.  The acoustics were good and while the music was loud, we were able to speak to each other, and our ears weren't bleeding when we left.  It's small and sort of awkwardly-shaped, so I'd recommend going early to snag a good seat if you are intent on seeing the actual stage.  Or, if you'd rather lurk in the dark shadows, then that's cool, too.  I'd plan ahead for both of those options. Despite a full house, the waiter kept up well, navigating the narrow spaces effortless to get to us.  Our only disappointment was that 2 of the drinks we wanted weren't available after we had gotten all excited about a warm, fuzzy Christmas-y drink.  But, life goes on.  What we did have was good and not priced too terribly high.  We are looking forward to going back soon to enjoy another show.",300,"Milwaukee, WI",1,8,2,10

The place has always been a little cramped, but that only adds to the character of the spot. Over the years, the place had become a little rundown and its ongoing operation was in some question, but in 2016 John Dye (owner of Bryants and At Random) purchased and renovated The Estate. It still retains the feel of an old-fashioned jazz club but now is clean, comfortable, and offers a terrific menu of cocktails. Come early to enjoy the recorded jazz or arrive later for an 8 or 9 pm show. Or, for you night owls, the Estate has some occasional late-night shows at 11 or 11:30.  (Be sure to check the calendar on the website.)  Many of the shows have no cover, but don't be cheap with a $5, $7 or $15 cover. Jazz is a terrific American art form, and Milwaukee has more than its share of great talent deserving support. The cover here is a fraction of what you find in larger cities, so take advantage of the great live music and a fair price.The Jazz Estate is open seven nights a week from 5 pm to 2 AM. It generally takes no reservations and sells no tickets (although a few rare shows may offer reserved advanced tickets), so arrive early for shows if you want good seats.

Nice spot for some photo ops with your friends.You do need to reserve a table in advance, and we booked the private group area with fire table that seats 4-6.

The menu was really well thought out (graphics on POINT!) and the drinks were fun, whimsical, and TASTY! I will say my previous tiki experiences had me thinking the cocktails would be really strong, but the two I had were really balanced, not too boozy.

You can tell they put a lot of time, effort and thought into the creation of this space. The outdoor front door is checked by a hostess and that's when you can see all of policies and procedures they've put together in terms of making sure everyone stays safe and socially distant. The menu is adorable, custom-made and it's something that you take home as they don't want multiple patrons touching the same menus. The drinks are inspired! My fiancé had two of the strawberry daiquiris and every table we saw had a bunch of the Miami Vice drinks (I would have tried, but I don't like coconut aka pina colada flavors) which are the special Slushy-based delicious concoctions that they've created using the slushy frozen drink machine that's behind the outdoor bar. The menu is packed with creative flavors is obviously heavily rum base to do with such of a tiki theme, however their namesake the pufferfish drink is actually made with primarily gin it's delicious has a very crisp and light flavor with passion fruit. You get a secret message in your Port Light and The Devil's Worship has a ""big ass"" branded Lost Shale ice cube. Speaking of ice cubes, most of all the other drinks have the type of ice cubes that are like small ice cube bobbles similar to Sonic-type which make the tiki drinks all that much better!I will say they're following a lot of great policies - hand sanitizers in the entry, six feet apart for all tables at the tent, everyone stays put unless you have to go the restroom, servers are all masked and gloved, guests are all masked unless you're sitting at your table or taking your one photo op, and if you go to the restroom or out to smoke they have you exit through the building and come back through the outside entry way, so there's only ever one flow of traffic. All of the tables get deep cleaned when guests leave. Truly impressed - will be back!",391,"Bay View, Milwaukee, WI",0,15,3,10

It's on full display around the main bar - lots of historic photos of Puddlers through the years, documenting the tavern's history in the union landscape of old Milwaukee, right down to the name ""puddlers"" itself. It's worth a trip to Puddlers Hall if for no other reason than to check out this cool, lesser known bit of the city's history.When I visited, it was 3pm on a Wednesday - not exactly prime drinking time.

From the outside, it looks like another indescribable dive with the stone exterior and only one window up high. The sign is a single numeral, 2. Hubsy gushed about this bar enough that I resisted until Saturday night when I felt restless. Inside, Two is a low-lit neighborhood bar. There's a fair number of large tables for groups and the booths noted by other reviewers behind bead curtains. Two glows like the inside of a supernatural heart. Warm, red, and playing some solid music -- some I recognized (Death Cab for Cutie) and others I didn't (the bluesy tune). There's a jukebox. The location:Located next to its flashier cousin, Art Bar, it's easy to miss Two. About 3-4 blocks west of Humboldt on Burleigh, use Art Bar as your landmark. There's plenty of unmetered street parking on Burleigh or the residential streets. The service: When we walked in, we were greeted immediately by the bartender. She also asked if we had ever been there before. Based on the people who came in after us, my guess is that she knows the regulars. Very cool. The drinks:My first sip of Dark and Stormy was all rum. I didn't mind, so when I stirred, it was perfectly balanced. Good ginger beer, good rum. The Moscow Mule Hubsy got was sweeter than my drink which was surprising but delightful. Each of our drinks were $8.50. I didn't pay attention to the beer specials, but maybe next time. Next time:I'll probably stay longer to do some people-watching and writing.

It had been on my radar for years, but rumo(u)rs of a creepy, swing-tastic vibe kept me away initially. This all changed one fateful night... Art Bar was hosting some loud-ass band and smelled particularly strongly of ""Riverwest,"" so we walked in and walked right back out. Upon leaving, some sidewalk smoker suggested we check out the spot next door for a more chill + relaxed ambiance. The recommendation took hold with little arm twisting as I had most surely consumed a beverage or two prior to my arrival at Art Bar so... what the hell? L and I mosey back inside, except exactly one door over.Two's retro and mid-century-modern-esque, with booths for two covered in beads and curtains lining the walls. Communal/general seating's at high top tables, a few comfy lounge-y chairs, and the bar only. (An aside: Those booths? If it were my bar, they'd go, or at the very least, I'd ditch the curtains and beads. This place is great, and the whole ""romantic"" angle isn't necessarily bad, but it's not so apt in my opinion, either. Sorry, owners. I hear you're nice folks but I'm just being honest. Plus, it's a great spot without the angle! I'd sit at booths with friends if I didn't feel like they thought I might be trying to make out with them. Also, I've never seen anyone sitting in those booths. That says something, I think.)ANYWAYS...Two's pretty rad and I like the spot quite a bit. The bartenders are always nice; a special shout out to *Brandon, who pays attention to Yelp and is a real-deal super funny/nice dude. There's a diverse set of regulars and patrons and the bar stocks solid boozes and suds. I can get a well-made hot toddy, a Rehorst gin and tonic, or interesting craft brews. I can also apparently get amaretto-flavored vodka these days, which I am excited yet a touch embarrassed about liking and ordering. (Don't you judge me! Or go ahead. I don't care at all, actually.)Overall: Two's a chill, old-school/retro lounge-type spot nestled just next to Art Bar on Burleigh in Riverwest.

Last time I had the Charo's Best Friend (tropical Buffalo) which had good heat tempered by the pineapple, but I wasn't crazy about the coconut flavor. My husband had the Swinal Tap this time (maple, bacon, and BBQ) which was sweet and tasty. Last time he had the JB3 (Bourbon, Brown Sugar, Buffalo, and Jerk) which was savory with a touch of heat.

We got plain but I later wished I had tried a flavor on them since others recommended it, but hubby is picky. Fairly wide selection of house taps, but nothing that I was crazy about.

I got the Jamaican me hottest 10 wings for 14$ but honestly the first bites weren't mouthwatering as I thought they would be. Good large wings but they burnt the wings a little too much giving a dry flavor at time. The onion rings had a lighter batter which was alright while the chipotle lime ranch dipping sauce was super good. My recommendation would be to put the lime ranch sauce on the wings as a flavor choice. The price was a little high at 22$ after tax and before tip for onion rings and 10 piece wings. Lastly the service was very welcoming and enjoyable. With that being said, I'll give them a 4/5 due to the large wing size and lime ranch sauce. Above average.",143,"Milwaukee, WI",1,0,0,0

I was SO DISAPPOINTED in the owners business manner that I'm still in shock. First off, my husband pulled up a seat next to me at the bar which apparently was the ""order area."" We would've completely understood being asked politely to move his chair, although this place was not busy, but the owner without saying ""Hello, Welcome etc..."" stated very rudely ""your in my order area theirs not a chair for a reason!!"" Ok we get it we moved the chair. I asked, without knowing the liquor laws in Wisconsin because who looks that up before walking into an establishment, if he had any ciders that i wasn't a beer drinker but i wanted to try to enjoy something that ""non beer drinkers"" would enjoy. He gave me a whole lecture how he can't have ciders because of liquor laws and the federal government not getting they're share so he doesn't have a cider. But he could refer me to bars in the area who could accommodate my request. Still shell shocked and wanting to give them a chance i said i smell a strong sense of raspberry. His response ""well obviously because I have a hard black raspberry seltzer!"" So can i try please sir? Well he gave me a bathroom cup smidge taste of foam and slammed it down. Then my husband who was so excited to try his beer asked for a New England IPA. I tried my ""seltzer"" and said that I wasn't a fan does he have something else I could try like a sour, blonde etc?' He then said I have coke, Diet Coke and sprite. I was so appalled and taken aback that I sat quietly. He then said to my husband ""so I guess your one and done then huh?!"" Then the couple who sat next to us who were already sitting their drinking a beer leaned over and said ""I can't believe he spoke to you that way, we're leaving because he clearly doesn't need our business..."" So in retrospect, after reading other reviews I'm sure the owner is nice and wonderful. However, my experience was the opposite and that's what's sticking in my head and prompting me to write this review in the first place.UPDATED REVIEW SINCE OWNER RESPONSE:I wanted to thank Chris for his humble response. That to me shows true leadership and care for his business and the experience others may have might not always be golden. I want to commend Chris for taking my experience and working to make improvements so other '""non-beer"" drinkers can have a better experience. I know from reading other reviews that your a good man and truly care about the customers experience. I might not like the traditional beers that are mainstream. However, your blonde, sour or another suggestion would've been appreciated so I felt just as important as your typical beer drinkers as every brewery is different.

I tried the Cailiflower Croquettes and the Oklahoma Onion Burger with house-made chips, house pickled-veggies, and house-made dips amd sauces. The onion burger is made with gruyere cheese, crispy shallots, fresh romaine, and a house onion dip. The patty was perfectly cooked to medium, and the potato bun was lightly toasted and buttered. There was a tad too much salt in the shallots or the dip, but this was one of the best burgers I've had in town, and I'd get it again in a heartbeat!The chips were also perfect for my taste. Usually, house-made chips are bitter and visually unappealing from being overcooked and cooked in overused oil. These were thin, crispy, and perfectly seasoned. They were served with a house ranch dip that I tasted a hint of citrus in. I don't like cauliflower unless it's roasted, but now I like cauliflower in croquette form, too! The croquettes are filled with a cauliflower puree and SarVecchio parmesan, and served with a tarragon dressing. So good with a nicely seasoned batter and light crunch!I would eat all of this again, but I want to explore more menu items, so I'll change it up next time.

Logically, we started at Bitter Cube, an establishment for all things bitters. Bitter Cube is, for those not familiar with it, is a local store, bar, and production plant for bitters. They offer tours, tastings, and a very interesting menu featuring their amazing products. They don't use the run of the mill Angostura, which every place in Wisconsin keeps rotting behind the bar for the occasional Old Fashioned request. They have a flavor to enhance every drink, sauce, or baked good under the sun, including everything from root beer to grapefruit.The tour is about $15/person, a real bargain considering they throw in 2 drinks!  The tour takes about a half hour.  It is a really casual affair, but packed with awesome information.  We got to see the bar area, party room, and the whole production plant.  The workers were even packaging up a giant order while we waltzed through.  Our tour guide was hilarious, very knowledgeable, and managed not to roll his eyes when one of our tour mates asked if they considered ever taking the company organic.  Ugh.Following the tour, everyone was given the opportunity to taste and smell about 10 different products.  It was the best aromatherapy experience I've had in years!  The really interesting part was that we didn't really need to cleanse our pallets between products because everything was so distinctly different.  We also got some fun little stories about the origins of a few of the flavors.We ended up purchasing a sampler after our tour and cannot wait to experiment with it.  I'm not much of a drinker, so I'm dying to try the cherry vanilla flavor in a batch of chocolate chip cookies.  I'm certain my husband has more exciting plans for it.  I highly recommend people swing by and take the tour when they have them available.  They have a great website that is easy to navigate and can be used purchase tickets online.  They also have some excellent weekly specials and other events.  The vibe, the products, the staff, the menu, and pretty much everything about this place is amazing.  We are lucky to have this place call Milwaukee home.  Check it out!!",381,"Brookfield, WI",0,7,1,4

There were a few long tables and some groupings of chairs- probably comfortably fits 30-40.Cocktails are crafted with care (do note this means slowly- artistry takes time, folks) and are priced very reasonably with that in mind- I believed the range was $9-14. I tried the Mint Tea Punch (like a boozy sweet tea) and The Kid. The standout drink was either my friends Mason Dixon, literally served in a peanut bag with snack peanuts! or my husbands Manhattan Escape Room- the smoked cedar was amazing.All in all I loved it and give a solid 5, but could you maybe turn a few more lights on?",202,"Madison, WI",0,2,0,1

We arrived about 1130 on a Friday. The place was busy and we were told a 15 min wait... that became a 45 min wait. The interior of the place was packed wall to wall as people kept coming in. One employee was trying to keep track of all people coming in & requesting tables. When your time came he simply called out your name... it was almost impossible to hear it unless you were right there. It was very loud with being packed & people talking. Once sat our server waited on us quickly.  3 of us ordered the bloody Mary's. One regular,  one baconado,  and one cheesehead. We also ordered fried pickle fries and onion rings. We immediately got our beer backs for our bloodies and our appetizers came out quickly. Our bloody Mary's took 30 mins and our beer backs were warm by the time they came. The bloodies were great once we got them though.  It was a little disappointing to see we got ours long after other tables who were seated after us got theirs. Not sure what the disconnect was....For lunch we all ordered burgers. Burgers came quickly and were delicious.  The buns are epic. I'm giving this place 4 stars... they have some kinks to work out but given it was busy & places are understaffed its slightly understandable.",232,"Independence, IA",0,1,0,2

First round I ended up trying a flight of some various whiskey & bourbons that were available. Your choice of 3 and comes with a glass to take home! Quite the deal! Next rounds I went for a Manhattan and a Milwaukee Sour since I was intrigued by the grape juice foam it was topped with. Manhattan was solid, and Milwaukee Sour wasn't really my thing but at least I can say I've tried a grape juice foam in a cocktail.

We were sat quickly and given menus. Drink menu only avail through a QR code but other menu was regular. I would recommend having a regular drink menu available also ad my parents who are in their 70's were with us and aren't smart phone users. I had to continually read drink menu to them... Anyway server was attentive and was able to talk about menu items we asked about. For appetizers we ordered the cheese curds and a pint of bacon. Cheese curds came and I admit I was disappointed when looking at them. $15 for these? Well boy was I wrong... they were worth every penny. It was a mix of white and yellow curds in a homemade batter. When eating one you could string the cheese across the table. Phenomenal.  The pint of bacon was also great- my parents thought I was weird to order it but quickly understood once they bit into it. For the main course I ordered the Made Men Flatbread. It was huge and delicious.  Hubby & my mom got the blackened shrimp tacos from the app menu. They said they were good but the shells were a bit greasy. My dad ordered the sconnie cheese which he thoroughly enjoyed. My daughter got the basic burger which was just that but she was happy.

The Explorium Brewpub is a large trendy pub in Milwaukee's historic third ward. We came on a Wednesday night and it was pretty busy, but the servers did a great job keeping up with the buiser crowd. The layout of the space is super fun. Lots of seating that's nicely spaced out, a really cool open bar, and a nice semi outdoor space that's lined with string lights and complete with a roaring fire. As for food, the appetizers were phenomenal! We came with a larger group so we ordered quite a few, and each one was amazing. I also loved that they had some creative options like fried meatloaf, reuben rolls, and the LCD cheese (pepper jack cheese and buffalo sauce fried in a rolled wonton shell, whaaaat). We went with the cheese curds, pint of bacon, and the soft pretzel. The cheese curds were the best I've had (and I've had a lot in Wisconsin). They outside was crispy and the cheese melty and delicious. Pint of bacon was a pint glass filled with candied bacon. SO GOOD. Pretzel was the one thing that didn't blow me away, but overall was still pretty good. I ordered the brew burger and fries for my meal and I think I made the mistake ordering it medium well, because it came out very well done. This is really my only gripe, because it ended up being pretty dry and difficult to eat. Everyone else seemed to enjoy theirs though, so I think next time I'll just need to order it done medium.

My two favorites were the creamsicle and blueberry. Both light, smooth and not bitter.If you are uncertain about how hot is hot, get the sauce for the Nashville Hot Chicken Sandwich on the side. A little goes a long way. The chicken was juicy and although I prefer a creamier coleslaw, it was still a nice compliment to the hot sauce. And the cheddar mashed potatoes are a fun swap for traditional fries. The Made Man pizza had soft and chewy crust with an impressive, hot cheese pull.

He said the Pedal Tavern is keeping him open as all the nearby foundries have closed - so get in here while you can and travel back in time!

Unsure if this is typical (pre pandemic times) but they personally contacted me ahead of time to confirm time, party, allergies and any special occasion.We arrived about 15 minutes prior to our original time and seated promptly. We dove into the menu and ordered some small plates: steak tartare, oysters on the half shell, foie gras and lobster pothole.I think I still prefer oysters from St. Paul's fish company over here. A broader selection to choose from. I throughly enjoyed the complex and balanced flavors from the foie gras. A little sweet from the berries and savory from the bourdin. The lobster pothole was a favorite amongst the table. The sourdough had a nice crunch to the outside.I think there was a bit of lapse in service and mainly communication because we had been served all small plates before I asked the server if we could order a main entree. This lead to us sitting for longer than I typically would for dinner.As far as dishes, we had the lobster pot pie, whitefish and miso scallops. These entrees were a lot larger of a portion than I expected so if you plan on doing small plates ahead of time, maybe consider sharing.The lobster pot pie was highly recommended. I opted out of the mushrooms (personal preference) but the top is light and flakey, similar to a croissant. I'd say the lobster was a bit over cooked and chewy but you do get a decent amount.Someone ordered the miso scallops. The scallops were pretty salty here and an utter disappointment with the salty risotto.The crust on the whitefish was phenomenal. Paired with the mustard sauce (if you like tangy) was a good option. The three of us shared the creme brûlée with the pistachio on the side due to an allergy. The berries and pistachio (I poured this on after the person had their fair share of the dessert) paired well to off balance the sweetness of the creme. The bits of brown sugar were too chewy and off putting to everyone in the group.",364,"Madison, WI",0,0,0,0

The burger seems incredibly similar if not the same as one of my childhood staples, McDonald's Big Mac. I realize that may be blasphemy to some, so forgive me. Coach's Pub 'N' Grill is a sports bar located on the south side of Milwaukee. I could not find much on their history, but it looks like they opened in 1999. Their version of the Big Boy Burger includes two beef patties, lettuce, cheese, and Big Boy sauce on a seeded bun. It tasted the way I remember Big Macs tasting as a kid, which is great. Coach's take on the sandwich is a definite upgrade as unlike the Big Mac it contains two slices of cheese instead of one, there was much more sauce, better tasting bun, and juicier patties. A McDonald's Big Mac suffers from a poor  ratio of bun to meat (too bready, patties too thin), but Coach's ratio was spot on. Next time I'm craving a Big Mac I'll for sure head to Coach's instead. Doughboy approved   *My only criticisms are minor and have nothing to do with the food. First, there is online ordering available but only by using the Toast app. The Toast app was not working properly when I tried using it, which was frustrating. Second, when I went to pick up my sandwich there was no clear pick up area. It would be nice if signage or more obvious signage was posted inside.

Coach's was in complete violation and disrespect of the COVID19 orders.We're in the thick of COVID19 under a Safer at Home order. Bars are closed and restaurants are allowed to do carry out or curbside. They advertise curbside on their social media, website and a banner outside their pub. I call and ask to place a ""curbside order"" and the woman on the phone responds ""just come inside."" The parking lot was full. Full. I walk into a full bar. There is no possible way to keep 6 feet between myself and others. There are multiple people sitting at the bar with drinks. Multiple people playing casino or arcade games within inches of each other. Kids, I came here for curbside. Definitely not this. My food wasn't ready. So I'm just waiting in this place with people in close proximity. No changes in behavior. No precautions. There was no place to go to be 6 feet apart from others because there were so many people.I've been trying to support small businesses. Many are doing curbside or carry out. I have never seen patrons gathered and milling about like this. One guy said out loud ""I'm not getting any food"" whilst he sat at the bar with a drink. Every other business that I've gone to has fully done curbside and if patrons are entering the building chairs are removed or turned over. This was business as usual. I get my food and left. I phoned and asked to speak with the manager and relayed my feedback. The manager may have been drinking. He raised his voice, got condescending and argumentative. Stated that he doesn't have capacity to do curbside service and won't ""make customers wait outside."" Businesses don't have to offer curbside service. But please don't advertise it and not actually offer it. It's why I choose this place. Good customer service means listening to customer feedback and working to make customers happy if you can do so. This phone call just made things worse. Absolutely, don't tell at me or blame things on me. As the manager told me that it was my fault. I've made concerted efforts to support small businesses as much as possible during this pandemic. This is a business that I will never again support in any fashion.

The place looks like your cozy neighborhood bar with a U shaped bar with tiny tables in the front windows and a lower dining area in the back. Plenty of flat screens in all directions. There is about 12 different tap beers and I chose the Lakefront river west stein. The menu is standard bar food with burgers, wings, pizza, wraps, sandwiches etc but one thing stood out which was the Ruben. The Ruben cones with various sides.The place has a different soup of the day menu for December and I chose the loaded cheddar and potato as my side. What a great choice because this was no can and very good on a cold winter day, see my pictures. The soup was very creamy and cheesy with perfect potatoes, not too soft and not undercooked. There was firm pieces of bacon that just complemented everything and it was topped with shredded cheese. The Ruben came steaming to my table and looked perfect, see the pictures. You could tell just looking at it that it is the real deal, not deli sliced meat but hand carved corn beef. The marble rye was good quality and toasted perfect. The sauerkraut was fresh and crisp. The meat was lean/tender and moist and seasoned with nice melty Swiss cheese. This was a top quality Ruben with a quality side soup.This local bar is putting out great quality food that is way far from bar food and it is really a decent restaurant in a bar.

Every time I visit, I liked this place less. The one female bartender seriously overcharges for drinks on the ""buy one get one free"" drink night, which is pretty much any night they feel like offering this special.I visited this establishment last night in attempt to hang out with friends and forget about all the horrible problems I have been dealing with. The bartender was making friendly chatter while trying to get me to order another drink, asking my plans for the following day. I informed him I did not wish to drink much as I needed to get up early and hit the gym, tan, and then I had 3 hours of dance&cheer practice. He took this and ran with it....""So you need to go run on the treadmill like a gerbil because 'that's what people expect you to do',"" he says. To which I react, I enjoy working out and challenge myself on a daily basis. Then he starts on the ""fake baking"": ""You might not look orange in this light, but you are orange."" {Note: I tan MAYBE once every 7 days, more like once every 10 days and I am far from orange.} I asked him to please stop harassing me and his words would make me cry, but he continued to mock the activities I enjoys/are unnecessary, and then informed me that I wear too much makeup {note: i only wear eye makeup and some lipgloss}.I finally couldn't take it anymore. I yelled at him; I told him he was being mean and I didn't appreciate his words and that I don't go to the bar to be mocked. I quickly snatched up my belongings, along with the $3 tip I had previously left, and stormed out vowing to never return.I am appalled that such an establishment would allow their employees to mock patrons in such a manor, especially after informing him that his words were unkind and I was having a difficult time the past couple days.

We were looking for a place to grab dinner and drinks before a Bucks game that wasn't on water street or in deer district. Overall, this was a great pre-game hangout with a relaxed vibe and tons of tvs with sports games on. We walked in and were seated immediately. Tables were reasonably spaced out and if a patron was walking around without a mask, staff gently reminded them about the mask requirement. There was one large group of abut 10-15 people hanging out, but they were spaced out enough/far away from other patrons that it wasn't uncomfortable to be near them within the bar/restaurant. The menu was stacked with awesome vegetarian options. The spinach and artichoke dip was divine. The impossible burger was so-so, but the brioche bun was on point. We also 100% should have skipped the cheese curds. These were more like Culver's curds than traditional WI bar curds. They did, however, let you sub tots for fries for no up-charge (score!) The main drawback was the service (wha-wha).  We got set up with drinks and food quickly but, had to wait and wait for to-go boxes and the check. We were just flat out ignored for a solid half hour after it was very clear we were done eating. Also, we sat at the bar and there was a waitress who just stood in front of us staring off into space.

We were a table of 4, another table of 4 got seated next to us after we were already sitting for a bit and they got their order taken/food brought out way before we did. Again, the food itself was fine but the service was not worth the wait.

It's home to me.The bartenders are legitimately the best in the business. Why is that? Because they actually converse with you, all while keeping your drink full. Seriously, I'm pretty sure they're allergic to empty glasses. The drink specials. OH! The drink specials! There's one every evening, on top of the famous disco ball 2.4.1. Friday nights feature 3.4.1 on rail mixers and tap beer, which makes it possible to drink all night on $10. Drink pours are strong, just as they should be. So beautiful that I could cry.The crowd is wonderful. Often times I find myself hating gay bars because the crowd is too much to deal with. Not the case with TITS. There's a huge crowd of regulars here, which is one of the best signs to see when checking out a bar. This really is the gay Cheers. Word to the wise however, this place can get crowded on Friday/Saturday nights.The decor closely mimics your grandmother's basement, circa 1984, with a wonderful gay touch. There is a raging debate as to whether this place is a dive bar or not. I would say it doesn't really fit entirely into the dive bar category. It is a dive bar in the sense that the drinks are cheap, the pours are strong and it's dark and somewhat homey. On the other hand, its really clean, the bartenders are amazingly friendly and, I don't feel like I'm going to catch the Clap from a visit to the bathroom. So, is it a dive bar? Nope. Does it have somewhat of a divey feel to it? If you must.Hands-down, TITS is my favorite bar in Milwaukee. I'm not really sure what I would do if it were to ever go away.

I decided to stop back a little later, at which point they said they had no card under my name and no record of my order. Mistakes happen, streams get crossed, this comes with the territory - however, the bartender was SO unnecessarily combative with me in response that I just can't shake the experience.""So you're accusing me of stealing your card?"" No? I think you were busy, things slipped through the cracks, and my card got lost, perhaps given to the wrong person. ""So what do you want me to say?"" I don't know? Anything that would imply accountability, maybe? Something that isn't actively hostile?He then pointedly ignored me for the rest of the night.Again, I get it, mistakes happen, especially during a rush.

They offer daily specials, which you can check out on their website.Last night was Mexican Monday Madness. They had $1 short margaritas and mai tais, $3 for a tall. I started with a Mai Tai, and it was definitely from a premade mix. My fiancée had a regular margarita on the rocks, also from a mix and too sweet for him (I finished it). I then opted for a mango margarita.... that was a solid choice. It was blended, not as sweet as our previous drinks, and pretty tasty. I ordered the tacos and a side of beans. $1 for ground beef, $1.50 for steak and chicken, and choice of hard or soft shell. I tried all 3 on soft shells. I think the chicken was my favorite, it was seasoned really well and the meat was super tender. The other two were not bad, especially for the price. I appreciated that they loaded all 3 with lots of meat, plus the usual toppings of lettuce, tomato, cheese. The beans were meh, they were refried and nothing spectacular.Joe had a chicken chimichanga with a side of rice and beans. I got to try the chimichanga, it was really yummy!! It was packed full of the same delicious shredded chicken I had in my taco and lots of cheese. He said the rice and beans were also meh; they just weren't flavorful.We have been here previously for Friday Fish Fry. This is a hot spot in the community, it is always packed on a Friday evening. They offer all you can eat cod or smelt as well as other fish options (including baked). I have always enjoyed the fish fry, I prefer the cod. It has a light batter and is very meaty. The French fries are simple yet delightful... I love fries!Service is kind of hit or miss. Sometimes it is very good, the server is friendly but sometimes it is rather lackluster. The servers are always attentive, it is just the demeanor/attitude (the whole appearance/attitude of ""I love my job"" versus ""When will my shift ever end?"" or ""I hate my  job.""). Food usually comes out pretty quick.Amelia's is easy to find, and overall a good place to stop to/from the airport.

The food was good (it could have been great), the service was good, and the dessert was fantastic. As an appetizer we shared the jalapeño chicken soup which was not spicy whatsoever (slightly misleading) and quite difficult to eat as the veggies were cut very largely and the dumplings were thin and very long. The taste was not bad but it was underwhelming.For my meal, I had the ham & cheese sandwich on a pretzel bun. The sandwich was not bad but it could've definitely had some improvements. The description said the sandwich would come with a honey mustard sauce on it which it did - but it was just way too much. It overpowered the taste of the whole sandwich and I had to scrape a bunch of it off. I was also disappointed that no aspect of this sandwich was warm. This includes the cheese - so it was just kind of like a block of cheese on a cold ham sandwich. I wish it would've been somewhat warm. My boyfriend got the sirloin steak sandwich and requested that they add beer cheddar to his sandwich. His came with the cheese melted on which was much better than mine. There was a ""truffle peppercorn mayonnaise"" on his sandwich that just tasted like normal Mayo to me but his sandwich overall was very tasty. I enjoyed it much more than mine.Finally, the best part of the meal was hands down the dessert. I will be coming back to Story Hill BKC if for nothing else besides the warm cherry upside down cake. It was perfectly sweet, tart, and warm. It was comforting and oh so deliciously balanced. If you or someone you know likes cherries, this is a must have.Overall, there were some parts of this meal that could have done better but other parts that I found to be very enjoyable. I would personally return to Story Hill BKC if I was near this area but I can not say I would seek out the food if I were not nearby.

To be honest, I'm not a fan of fruit tones in my coffee, so I was a little hesitant when all the coffee notes seemed to have some sort of fruit. Somehow, it works for me! It's not incredibly overpowering or bitter and was super smooth. It does take a little more TLC to make the coffee since they use pour overs, but the taste is incredible! They work so efficiently that it was done in no time. I was with friends who love a good cold brew and they had a variety to choose from as well. A pour over and cold brew (i think both 16oz) ended up coming out to around $7 which wasn't bad! I'm not sure if they charge extra for milk, but it seemed nothing like those Starbuck's or Colectivo prices imo We took our coffees to go, but the work space looked very comfortable and there was ample outdoor space directly in front of the store and towards the side.

The place is way bigger than it looks with a log cabin inn feel and a big bar with spacious tables around it and an African cichlids fresh water tank that was surprising, not really because the fish store is next door. The crowd was a nice mix from younger to older people which was nice, not a bad vibe at all like some places.Once again the bartender didn't know what a gin Rickey was that I ordered but he was nice enough. I ordered the BYO sandwich with crispy chicken as my protein choice with pepper Jack cheese, Mayo, lettuce and tomato that had frys as an option to go because I wasn't feeling eating at the bar today.To my surprise it looked better than I expected with fresh toppings and big frys, not steak cut but  not thin at all. The frys were pretty good and I don't like most frys because they were exactly how I like frys with a crispy shell and soft center seasoned nicely, good job. The crispy chicken sandwich looked good with a golden crispy breast. To my surprise also the breast was moist and tender unlike the last bar chicken sandwich I had. With the Mayo and fresh tomato/lettuce this was was a decent crispy chicken sandwich but I forgot to ask for bacon which would have made it better.Overall my lunch was pretty good that hit the spot and as with every review it depends on what you order and how it was prepared so the next person might have a different experience but I would definitely go back.",324,"Milwaukee, WI",1,3,0,2

We looked at our options and said no, there was a reason for us coming in early, we sat in this area several times before without issue and it was a Tuesday afternoon with no competition for the tables as few folks were even there. The young gal reluctantly agreed and separated one four-seater from our four-seater table.Fifteen minutes later, a woman approaches us and wants us to move. We said no and gave the reasons. The lady announced herself as one of the owners and that this has always been their policy. We argued that it was Tuesday and no one was in the place and no one told us to move before. She was pissed as we argued that she needed to treat paying customers better instead of banking on ""what ifs.""A second young gal came to waitress for us saying the first gal was uncomfortable with us. The second server clearly had more people skills and we tipped her well for her seeing to our needs.The two other 8-seater set ups remained empty 3 and 1/2 hours into the game.

There are several good places, but I haven't found a place that rivals Timekeeper Distillery in Wausau around here (see my other reviews if you are interested in the shameless name drop). Well, I think this establishment is my new go-to for fancy cocktails in Milwaukee. Their signature cocktail, in my opinion, is the Banana Rumma. There is no physical banana in the drink, but rather banana that has been centrifuged to remove the solid portion but to retain the characteristic flavor. It was something that you truly need to drink to understand. It was very good. The atmosphere of the bar was very nice, modern and clean. I could easily spend a few hours here and it is a great place to go on a date or to take out-of-towners as a stop in the city. One thing you should note is that I had some difficulty finding the entrance. There is a gate off of Erie street that you walk through, sort of into an alleyway, to get to the entrance. You do not enter off of the street and people will probably look at you weird if you try to yank the doors off of the sidewalk open like I did. Definitely try this place out, you will be happy that you did.",230,"Milwaukee, WI",1,0,0,0

This place has become my go to winter outdoor patio! Seriously, they have got it down to an art here.The theme of the outdoor patio is ""apres ski"" and its totally got all the charm of a little ski slopes lodge. The outdoor tables and chairs are set up for a cozy seating experience. There are heat lamps everywhere, the chairs are covered in faux fur covers for warmth, and you are even given a warm blanket if you need one! I'm no fan of the cold, but I was quite comfortable sitting out there in late December. I felt like Elsa! Ha!There is a respectable list of warm (and cold) beverages, including my favorite, the Haute Toddy. I also really enjoyed their mulled wine, which is made with almonds in it. You really get the almond flavor and I thought it was pretty unique tasting. The drinks are a bit pricey - around $12 each, but totally worth it for this delightful outdoor patio.

I quickly ran through the restaurant in search of our waitress to cancel the drink. How does your waitstaff recommend a drink without knowing what's in it?!Next we ordered the brisket nachos. The entire table agreed they were amazing. The chips were crispy and the cheese and jalapeño added just enough heat. The brisket itself was very tender and juicy. For dinner we ordered 2 chipotle chicken sandwiches, street corn elote salad, and a cheese burger. The chipotle chicken sandwiches were cold. My DH ate his because he was hungry. I sent mine back and changed my order to chicken wings, knowing they had to be fried and delivered hot. The wings were meaty with good flavor. Our friend said his burger was luke warm (5 out of 10 stars).  The salad was was very good and my friend said she'd order again. It was my birthday and the table was sent doughnuts with ice cream, which was VERY nice! However, we weren't provided with any silverware and had to eat the desert with our fingers.

I stumbled upon The Standard thanks to the PubPass. Without it, I never would have known this place existed, primarily due to it's location. A few blocks from Brady, tucked in a residential neighborhood, The Standard serves up the classics, as well as the craft, in a laid back environment. Shoot the breeze with the bartender (seriously, he's a book of endless knowledge), catch a game with a Coors heavy, pet a dog or two, and just relax. This place isn't a dive, rather a casual blend of simplicity and personality.

Our typical wing spot in the area was closed for a couple of days for cleaning. We don't live in this town, so we really didn't have a backup plan. Thanks to Yelp, we landed at Brass Monkey. I was surprised how much open space there was inside. Plenty of seating, and the atmosphere was inviting.Our server greeted us right away, and was very sweet. We ordered some beers, cheese curds, and wings. I was a little surprised that the wings came in only 8 (traditional) or 10 (boneless). I'm used to ordering a dozen wings. However, when they arrived, I in no way felt shorted. The wings had A LOT of meat on them. Definitely didn't miss the extra 4 wings at all. I got the Inferno wings and my husband got the spicy garlic BBQ. They were both excellent. I was very happy with the level of heat with the Inferno wings. They're definitely not for the heat sensitive, but not ungodly hot to where all you can taste is heat. The flavor was VERY good! My husband's wings were also good, very flavorful with a nice kick. The cheese curds were EXCELLENT!! The cheese was extra melty and the batter was perfectly crispy. I am so happy that even though we didn't get the exact wings we wanted, we managed to find a more than satisfactory replacement. My only wish is that there were more sauces to choose from. However, since this isn't a wing specific bar, I think their selection is more than appropriate. I'm pretty jealous that Brookfield has two great places to eat wings within a mile of each other. We don't have any wings that are even close to this good in Madison.",305,"Madison, WI",0,1,0,0

The place is bigger than it looks from the outside with a rectangular bar and side rooms with tables and chairs.

The metal arm rest around the bar did have monkeys attaching them to the bar.

I was asked if I was there for the shuttle and I was not. I forget the the name of the exotic beer compared to the other four and that's what I had, flavorful and higher alcohol than miller. I was offered a menu and accepted it even though I was not hungry. It was small with apps, burgers etc. See my pictures. For future knowledge I asked if the burgers are char grilled or my least fav flat grilled and I was told char grilled.The couple next to me were there for the shuttle and paid $ 19 for four double beers, maybe the size of a med soda to ride the shuttle to see Neal young at summer fest.The mix of people were regulars with young and older people with the shuttle crowd.

Big congrats to the chef for his James Beard nomination. Very well deserved!We started with a couple of cocktails - with a few more a little later! Really enjoyed the Cachaca Baron Cohen and the Deebo (see accompanying picture for the cocktail menu), but the drink that stood out for me was the ""I'm a Numbers Guy"". It was so unusual - starting with a very tart taste that became super sweet after swallowing a sip of it. Never tasted anything like it! The food definitely lived up to the standard that the drinks set. Even though the dishes are sized so that you can try a number of them, we probably ended up with more food than we strictly needed - but everything was so good! We did end up taking home half of the three cheese tartiflette pie (which was great with lunch the next day!), but everything else we polished off. We had the pretzel, octopus, salt cod hashbrown, anchovy deviled eggs, and short rib. Oh... and we can't forget the peanut butter pie!Like I said, everything was great, but for me the octopus was the big standout. It was marinated in citrus for I don't know how long and grilled - and it came out so tender and delicious. Just outstanding! For my wife, the peanut butter pie was equally memorable (okay, for me too I must admit).

It kind of reminds me of a college bar type vibe, with the friendliest staff and loads of shots. A lot of bar games are played there and it's way more spacious compared to some of the smaller bars in the more ""hipster"" parts of town. It has a front bar area with smaller tables and bar space, a pool table hallway/walkway and then a back area with full back bar and larger tables. It's not super swanky, but a great sports/dive bar for all of your game-watching needs. Also, the pub/bar food is amazing! Love the Ruben rolls, jalapeno poppers, the wonton-fried mozzarella sticks, and there's something about the pizza and the light, flaky crust there that keeps us coming back for more.I've been there for quite a few Packers games - it's the perfect spot. They've got a ""bladder buster"" (usually this is free miller lite or bud lite until someone uses the bathroom) and fun traditions like playing ""The Bears Still Suck"" song during commercials and Todd and Carol (the owners) often Emcee and make funny comments over the game or sometimes host raffles for cool prizes based off the shots you buy (smart).Todd and Carol are an absolutely delight and are always treat you like family when you're there.

WOW that's a lot of attitude for asking for a menu and she finished by saying it's on the wall with a chalkboard that says burgers, pizza, chicken tenders, mozzarella sticks, wings and Philly cheese. So I ask her what burgers to you have and more attitude so I say do you have specialty burgers like a western burger etc and more attitude so I finally say how do I order a burger then. She finally tells me it's build your own burger, dam was that so hard. Way to make an impression on an outsider who was looking for a regular bar food stop on my way home from work, clearly outsiders are not welcome in this neighborhood bar by the staff.Dam I'm sorry for asking questions from a place that serves food that has no menu to tell you anything and no prices for the food. I asked for a rare burger and I was told that medium is as good as it gets so I ordered a cheeseburger with cheddar, bacon, onion, pickles, lettuce and tomato to go.WOW this woman was the rudest/crappiest server that I have ever experienced and if I could give a 0 review I would. I'm not even going to review the food at all but I will post pictures of the cheeseburger and frys  because it will not move this review beyond 0 stars no matter how good or bad it is because it can't get any better or worse.In the time of C19 when customers are scarce and they want to spend money in your business, having employees that drive you away Is unbelievable.",410,"Milwaukee, WI",1,5,2,1

The root soup was so interesting. It was flavorful and herby. I added some salt and pepper to make it pop. I don't think you needed to. The corned beef was perfect. The mash potatoes in the cottage pie went well with the pot roast. I would prefer they didn't shred the meat thinly. That is just me. I like the meat to be a bit chunky and little bit fatty. Still it was a very good cottage pie. The carrot cake was so good as well. Not too sweet. It didn't have any raisins or nuts in it. I love having raisins and nuts in carrot cakes.

The only downside and reason for the 3 star review? The bartender we had twice (same guy) was incredibly rude (no it wasn't busy), and the drinks were not made with the appropriate alcohol as we watched the pours. I am completely understanding during these crazy COVID times if a bar is out of something to make a specialty drink, which we were told they were for two cocktail menu options. What is not okay is ordering a drink that is supposed to have Havana Club, and getting Sailor Jerry's. And then ordering a different one and getting rail gin instead of Henrick' s, and then lastly getting an Aperol Spritz and having it be so watered down it didn't taste like one at all. If you are going to substitute an alternate (and lesser expensive) brand of liquor to complete a cocktail, you should let your customer know, plain and simple. It made our group feel like they were being shorted what they paid for, despite receiving a finished drink that tasted OK.I'd like to give them the benefit of the doubt here, but its happened on two separate visits and seems to be the norm. Update your menu if you need to! I will say that the bouncer outside was the best! We sat on the patio when we went, and he was such a hard worker, always cleaning and clearing tables, and genuinely seemed to enjoy his job and the people he met. Not sure that I will be back on my own accord anytime soon, but would go if a group wanted to and would likely stick to a bottle of wine I can recognize the label on or a call cocktail I can specify!",318,"Milwaukee, WI",1,2,0,1

After a looooong workweek, Urbane Harvest brews quickly turned my frown upside down!  The bartender was very friendly and offered to provide us with a sample of any of their beers. After a few samples decided to do a flight of four. These folks know how to make beer for certain. I have consumed a fair amount of craft brews in and out of Wisconsin and there wasn't a beer I tried that I didn't like.  I know my opinion isn't nationally recognized yet but that is a huge compliment. What did I taste?-Espresso amber is definitely for the coffee lover bold but not overwhelming. -Ach ya der hey-fe Weizen if you don't try it just for the name you need to try it because it is super refreshing. -Radar De stout is the perfect blend of carmel and chocolate. -Lemony Wicket was VERY refreshing, smooth and crisp.

This little bar, tucked away in the the Washington Heights area, is simply charming. Everyone is friendly (the owners, the bartenders, and the patrons), the decor is simple and sleek, the music was not too loud, and the drinks and snacks were tasty!Two of my dear friends work here, so we came on a night they were working to sit and enjoy a bite and a glass of wine while they did their thing. Because the place is so small, we were able to socialize with our friends while still allowing them to do their job and not get in the way of the other customers.The place is tiny, I think maximum capacity is 14 or 15, and our group took up nearly half of that. That being said, even when we got to that maximum capacity point, it never felt ""crowded"" or ""claustrophobic,"" the mirror behind the wall definitely makes the place feel larger than it is. At several points, a person or a group walked past the windows, looked down to see everyone inside (the bar is just below the ground, making it both extra cozy and fun for people watching), and then turned around and walked in themselves. I think that just goes to show how inviting this place is! Although there is not a wide selection of drinks, the wines that they do have are good quality and reasonably priced. They also have a decent selection of beers for those who don't prefer wine, and various sodas for those who prefer non-alcoholic drinks. As for the snacks, the Marcona Almonds are deadly--they are salted and tossed with rosemary, and I could have eaten about 20 bowls of them. The ""cheese glop"" doesn't necessarily sound appetizing, but it sure as heck tastes amazing!  Long story short: cozy, quaint, and overall quite enjoyable!

They were very kind and helpful bringing dishes out to the patio where I was even though everyone else was inside. Then they topped it off my never forgetting I was out there and regularly checking up on me and bringing me fresh, cold water. The cheese dip was smooth and spreadable, a mix of five or six cheeses blended with some olive oil. Delish. The other dish was a mix of olives, capers, celery, crushed tomatoes, pine nuts and eggplant - one of the owners' grandmother's recipe! The cheese came with toast pieces and the cap. came with an assortment of crackers. Small dishes for the right price, and a nice accompaniment for the fresh white wine.

Both fry people thought they were bland (unsurprising since crinkle fries are the worst kind of fry in my opinion) and both of us potato pancake people were disappointed that they were very soft and not at all crispy.

After attending a brewery tour on the MKE Brewery side, I was directed by the G+G host that I could order food for delivery in the MKE brewery sitting area. I proudly placed my pretzel crusted cheese curd order (from the menu I was instructed to scan with my phone) and inquired about the dipping sauce, the woman who took my order said it comes with mustard(hence the pretzel crusted curds) and I asked for ranch and she said no problem...only to find out I was also charged for the side of ranch. Whereas I would have swapped out the mustard for the ranch since I was VERY disappointed when the curds arrived to my table. Low and behold the curds were NOT pretzel crusted, they were plain ol' regular bar curds.  I questioned the food runner who brought them out if these were pretzel crusted and he said ""no, we switched them"" and I informed him that their menu did not reflect that. So there I was with very salty plain curds and mustard and ranch . Someone thought I had requested a side of gravy . $13 down the drain. Given the increase of Covid capacities indoors, there were a fair amount of people in attendance. I recommend they need to check in on their bathrooms more often...I've visited them a handful during the course of my 4 hours there and they were always messy.

I didn't particularly enjoy the disco fries, but all of the other were very good. The pizza bread comes with slides of garlic bread and marinara topping. The bread-to-dip ratio is pretty far off as we had about 3/4 of our dip left once the bread was gone.My family enjoyed the Italian salad, lamb sandwich and burger. Unfortunrately, my meal never made it to my table (was missed by the server or the kitchen). Regardless, the appetizers filled me up so it wasn't too big of a bummer- but not great service either.Our most recent trip was pre-Bucks game and I would highly recommend this. We paid $7 for onsite valet parking. The nearest parking lot was charging $50. We had an easy walk to the stadium, and decided to stop in after the game for a beer.

I had my best friends visiting for one of their birthdays, and my fiancé and I thought we should all get dressed up and go out to dinner at Rock Bottom. The weirdness began when we were shown to our table. The hostess led us to the unfinished basement without being asked if that was alright. It was freezing cold and resembled the basement of a frat house. We should have asked to have been seated upstairs, as it was nearly empty, but we all just sat in shock. No one should have to ask not to eat in the basement.After discussing what to do, we decided just to laugh it off and make a quirky memory out of it, but then our food came.  Our appetizer came out first, and the sauce for our pretzel bites was served in a measuring cup. Our entree were also a major letdown. My fiancés chicken Parmesan came out nearly black. After complaining, they were very kind and remade the dish, but it came out just the same. One of our guests salmon and potatoes were cold and had to be reheated, and the other had to have her flatbread remade, as the sausage was entirely burnt. Mine was just all around bad, but I didn't have it in me to complain with everything being such a disaster.None of our party had ever complained about our food at a restaurant before.

My most recent visit was with the family. There was a band downstairs turned up a little louder than we would have liked so we moved to the upstairs deck (while we still can in WI lol).  Beer service was quick, their selection is amazing and always changing.  I had the Home lager this time around, it's a solid beer with a great flavor.  If you want something a little stauncher they have options all over the board from Pilsner to Double IPA and everything in between, they have your tastes covered.We ordered a bunch of food this time too.  Giant pretzel was amazing and even better with the house creamy mustard they bring out with it.  The curry popcorn served with it is good, but it had mixed reviews at the table.  The cheese curds by themselves are worth talking about, but that garlic herb sauce they bring with it just takes the cake.  That is some amazing food. Burgers and chicken sandwiches were the majority of the table and no one had a complaint at all.  The burger meat was moist, had great taste and the Russian sriracha sauce was the right mate for it.  The chicken sandwich was cooked just right and served on a brioche bun.  The herb Mayo gave it just the right extra flavor kick it needed to make it disappear before leaving.

We didn't see anyone picking up during our dinner. There was no indoor seating - which was kinda sad, considering how huge the restaurant is inside. All utensils/plates are disposable. Servers kept their masks on, and remained a respectful distance away while providing service. SERVICEAccording to our receipt, our server was Hayden O, and he was AWESOME! Mask stayed on properly, but we could still feel his caring, smiling demeanor. He also stayed a respectful distance even while taking our order, but not so much that we had difficulty hearing him (through the mask). He was prompt, nice, and just made our visit pleasant.

FOODWe weren't exceptionally hungry and still had to ride our bikes back home, so we shared.Double cheeseburger. It was meh. We weren't asked how well to cook the meat, and it came out a little burnt. Buns were also burnt a little. Overall, I felt it was too salty. There was a pickle on the side, but also slices of pickles in the burger - which I don't like. Lettuce was shredded and falling everywhere. Curry fries. As soon as we put in the order, we could smell the curry. I love curry, so I was really expecting awesomeness with these fries. And I think it could be... but these weren't fries. Not fried potato, but baked potato. Shaped like fries. But definitely baked rather than fried. So, full of spice, but not enough oil.Cheese curds. REDEMPTION! These were awesome! Worth every penny of the $10. Oktoberfest. On tap. Bursting with flavor. Super yummy.Overall, I would have been disappointed with the food here, but the service, appetizer, and beer totally made up for it.

We enjoyed some beers from their decently sized tap list, IPA variety was solid (and more importantly they were delicious). Dinner was great, mostly burgers but did offer a Friday fish fry. It's a little above average pricing I'd say but worth it because their curry fries with aioli are the best. Staff were friendly but so slow...waited 40 minutes for our tab. Maybe it was a ploy to get us to go to the bar and order more beer ;)",114,"Milwaukee, WI",1,0,0,0

People seem to really love it."" They'd walk in and be like whuuutt?The Roman Coin is not about aesthetics. It's about soul. The soul of old Milwaukee lives in this former Pabst tied house (a building whose original purpose was to sling PBR suds and PBR suds only). It's Milwaukee's closest thing to Cheers. Even if everybody doesn't know your name, in no time at all, you'll make new friends, and be chatting with them like you've known them your entire life after only half a beer.And dogs. Who doesn't love a place that loves dogs? (Cat people, that's who. ;) ) The Roman Coin loves dogs, and your well-behaved pooch is welcome here. We have engaged in many delightful conversations with fine, dog-loving folks when bringing our rat terrier, Neala, to Regano's. She seems to like it just as much as we do, too, with all of that loving attention.Speaking of the soul of Milwaukee, The Roman Coin carries a host of Lakefront brews -- Milwaukee's longtime craft brewery. They're usually about a buck cheaper, too, than you can get them elsewhere around the city. And if rich ale isn't your thing, get a High Life. They've got that too.Regano's Roman Coin. A throwback. A beautiful, timeless, rugged, and soulful throwback. I love it. Enjoy, just step carefully around the men's room. The footing is treacherous and probably the only thing in this place that could use a little work. Otherwise, Regano's is perfect.",279,"Milwaukee, WI",1,4,0,3

Not the best boba or ramen for sure, but wow I am so happy that there are these options for my workday lunches in downtown! At Kawa, I've enjoyed the yummy, fresh and hot takoyaki and ramen bowls on Milwaukee's recent gloomy days. If I am being picky - the chicken was a bit dry. I really enjoyed the overall experience. The boba at Make Waves is okay as the tea is just okay & the boba is kind of hard, but it will satisfy the craving if you really want one. The presentation of my chickpea toast was very pretty. I wished there would be more hummus, but it's still a good, balanced& light toast! The hummus from Middle East Side was great. It comes w a piece of large pita bread.

Dairyland was a safe choice for me since I'd had their food at a Yelp event at Zocalo. The burger and shake were good and met my expectations based on previous experience.

The place is relatively nice for a neighborhood bar/restaurant with a wood back bar, plenty of big screens, wall of big windows, free popcorn, ATM, hi tables/chairs and a couple intimate dining rooms. They have daily specials food/drink wise and bunch of taps with a great group of regulars.The wings are priced each so you can customize your order to your appetite which is very cool. I ordered 6 of the grilled, dry rubbed Caribbean jerk as my first sampling with celery and blue cheese sauce. The plate looked and smelled amazing with nice char grill marks. The wings were very tasty, meaty, moist, hot with a little crunch from the grilling, dam these are pretty dam good. Now for the sign of a place that takes great pride in their wings, the house made blue cheese sauce had nice chunks of blue cheese, no commercial salad dressing like the voted #1 served me. The celery was my idea of perfect, fresh, cold and crunchy and not room temp like the last wing place. The celery and blue cheese sauce demonstrates that they take great pride in the food that they serve. It was nice to finally meet Aubrey because I wanted to go to a different wing place that he owns picture wise but he suggested we go to McGinns instead and what a great call.My final thoughts is yes it's a bar but they are not serving bar food all, this kitchen after looking at the plates passing by me and having the wings is focused on sending out quality food.

The bread (Focaccia & soft white bread) was actually very good! The Fava Beans & Spring Peas was refreshing - perfect for summer time. I love ricotta and I was expecting more about the ""hand-dipped ricotta"" here because it's from the celebrity chef's team. But it's not special - don't get me wrong - it's still a very good appetizer but it's just not as fun as I expected. Entrees: everything in my grilled lamb chops was so good. I could not eat any raw food at the time so I asked for my lamb chops to be well done. It came with crispy skin and juicy cooked meat. Wow wow! The sides were also very good - loved the very flavorful ratatouille (stewed vegetables) a lot. Hubby enjoyed his Ravioli Provençal too. I took a bite of the ravioli - it cooled down already after 3 or 4 mins on our table. Not as amazing as the lamb chops but it's still a good beef ravioli dish. Wished the beef could be a bit more juicer. Dessert: the dessert, dessert wine and coffee menu was great. Everything looked amazing. We got a pine nut tart and it was so good! Nutty tart with refreshing ice-cream. Highly recommend it. Everything table also got almond cookies made from Chef Adam's Grandma's recipe for free - what a great idea!

The person who books their shows does an excellent job getting great bands and keeping fans of the venue 'in the know.' And because of this- it does tend to get a little packed on show nights. There usually is one bartender working- so when it's packed, expect to wait more than a couple of minutes for a drink. Patience is a virtue, man. There's a patio in back, you can smoke there. On non-show nights? It's chill, you can play Mortal Kombat. Drink cheaply. Enjoy the quiet. Quiet really isn't my bag, so I don't come here on non-show nights too often.",195,"Milwaukee, WI",1,4,2,4

The amount of batter on the curds and the amount of beer in the batter were both spot on.If you like the taste of bourbon, you'll love the bourbon BBQ. It's very pronounced in the sauce. Whether they serve chicken thighs by choice or by necessity because the cost of chicken wings is ridiculous right now, they made the right decision.

We were seated in this cozy warm dining room at a small two person table which made it kinda romantic! We started off with the the creamy parmesan polenta (it is no longer on the menu) and the crispy brussel sprout salad. The polenta was absolutely some of the creamiest and best I have ever had. The brussel sprout salad was in a class of it own, I would love to have that recipe! Having being raised by an Australian mother I grew up on leg of lamb. Seeing the Lavender & Anchovy rubbed rotisserie leg of lamb, I was sold. My wife doesn't care too much for lamb but said that she was happy with the two small plates.. the lamb came! It was Just a plate with big chunks medium to medium-rare of fresh cut lamb off of the spit. I fell in love on sight. The best way I think I can describe the quality and flavor of the lamb is, that for somebody who doesn't really like lamb my wife gave me a run for my money eating this fantastic meal! P.S.

The beer battered fries came with a great dipping sauce - a tahini poblano concoction that I would buy in bulk. The only dish that lacked a bit was the plum tart. Would have been better with a sweeter side - like straight up vanilla ice cream.The prices are reasonable, and the service fantastic. Laidback but on top of their game. The place is also tiny.

Located in a quiet residential neighborhood close to the often rambunctious goings-on of North Avenue, Champion's is inspired by the classic European concept of a public house (which is where the term ""pub"" is derived from). Even though these establishments traditionally serve libations, they are community-oriented and an important meeting place for neighbors and friends.Owner Maire Greenya, who runs the pub with her husband, Bob, inherited the pub from her grandfather-in-law, who still has friends who stop in.""It's definitely a family business, a labor of love,"" she said. ""We're not gonna get rich on it!""It almost seems ludicrous - who wouldn't want to build a club or license an outlet owned by a bar chain and make tons of cash? The answer is the dedicated folks who want to maintain the values set up by those public house proprietors.Greenya believes the key to the bar's relative success and longevity is owed partly to the location. ""(We're) in a residential neighborhood, we have great regulars. We're off the beaten path, we've been around forever. It's not just a 'come get drunk' sort of (bar). There's more to it than that,"" she said.Champion's is home to a traditional shuffleboard table, which means pickup games between strangers are almost expected. If asked, bartenders can unearth board and card games from behind the bar. Cribbage, Go and Uno are popular choices.Champion's doesn't serve food, but having pizza delivered there isn't frowned upon. The patio is extensive and offers more seating than indoors. Portions of it are covered, making this corner bar an ideal outdoor weekend gathering spot for big groups.Favorite summertime drink Greenya picks a vodka tonic with a slice of cucumber. ""It sounds weird, I know, but the cucumber takes the bitterness out of the tonic,"" she says. ""It's really light and summery.""",326,"Seattle, WA",0,0,0,0

The first part is a dark and dingy dive bar where the drinks were cheap, and the service was friendly.  At first there was one bartender...she had dreads and was super friendly and talkative.  She let us choose the next movie to play as there was a TV on each side of the bar.  It was this weird collection of horror and comedy movies from the 80s and 90s.  The other part was the dance venue area and if you went further back there were couches, pool table, darts, and a pinball machine. What I liked about the dance space is that at it followed the dark and dinginess of the dive bar.  It wasn't some fancy dance club filled with overly-dressed jerk faces dancing overly loud remixed pop songs.  It felt casual with a bunch of people that couldn't dance but enjoyed themselves. The theme was 90s music and they hit every genre possible.  Some of it was weird trance music I've never heard of, and then you had some classics from Jump Around to a dancier version of 4 Non-Blonde's What's Up.  The place was packed until bar close and was tons of fun!",261,"Green Bay, WI",0,5,4,3

There's a looooong bar and staff is generally attentive. There's sort of a run down feel to this place which tends to help their ambiance. Decently sized outside patio with ample seating and tables and smoking section under a well designed tarp during the winter. Large bathrooms, a lot of toilets, bathrooms are actually pretty cute. They have red lights, making the place warm hehe. Dance floor is pretty big! Music choice is pretty great too, but I just can't give it a four because although the run down feel helps its ambiance I think they could step it up. Looks a little bit like an old arcade when the lights go out! I had fun though, lotta dancing haha",145,"Chicago, IL",0,1,1,0

Being a musician, I play a lot of shows on Friday nights but when I have a gap in my schedule, I'm at Mad Planet's retro dance night. It's usually an odd group of people, over a pretty big age range, but people-watching is half the fun. Can't dance? Don't worry--I can't either and after a couple drinks, you won't really care.Speaking of, I'm cheap with my drinks. My go-to deals here are $3 PBR tallboys and $2.50 Point cans. I tend to pregame a little bit, so by the time I'm there and have had a couple drinks, I'm ready to embarrass myself on the dancefloor.Other noteworthy things about Mad Planet: -There's a coat check (and you're not going to want to carry it around with you), but I usually just leave my coat in the car. -Live music nights are fun too! Nice space and the sound guy is great.-If you smoke, they have a really nice patio out back. As a non-smoker, I still hang out back there until my lungs can't take it.-I've always had great experiences with the bartenders.-They have a pool table.-I don't come here enough.",215,"Milwaukee, WI",1,2,0,0

We chose​ the Alpine, and Asiago, and Parmesan.  All of the cheeses were delicious and perfect compliments to our wine selection.  We also tried the olive medley and meat board......perfection.  They did have chocolates for dessert but we were stuffed.The only thing that keeps this from being a 5 is it took a long time to get our wine and cheese.  We were the only patrons (which is a shame because the place really is special).  Our server was training another server and I think that is what was taking so long.  It was a delightful way to spend an evening but that is the only thing I would say needs improvement.Again with all of the people who are living downtown or visiting the downtown area, it would be beneficial to change up the storefront so people know it is there.  We will definitely be stopping in more!",300,"Bald Head Island, NC",0,10,3,7

There was only one other table present and between the time they left and near closing time it was just me and my guest. It was a Wednesday, I guess, but still. It's a nice little bar. Good for meeting a friend or blind date low-key.We didn't have any snacks so I can't comment on that. But I felt the wine pours were really short. I mean at $10 to $14 per glass, I want a good amount that I won't be done with in 10 minutes. But, places in Milwaukee overall are abusing this, I feel. I can go over to wine thief or any other place that sells liquor and get a really, really nice entire bottle of wine for $10-$15. This makes me miss the BYOBs when I lived in Chicago. Really awesome concept. Affordable AND a restaurant has to stand on it's own just on the food.I miss it. But, I get this is a wine bar. Was just underwhelmed with it.",195,"Denver, CO",0,0,0,0

On a weekday night, while there were always folks in the lounge, it never got anything close to packed (although the bar, being only 6 chairs or so, was full most of the time I was there). With ample space in the lobby, I had my choice of tables to pick out. Service was pretty solid, with my order being taken quickly, as well as food and drink being brought out in a timely fashion. While they do serve cocktails here, don't look for anything too fancy - the menu options are all classics - and I found my Bees Knees to be too gin-forward, which really dilutes the rest of the ingredients (particularly the honey) and makes the drink feel like it's thrown together a bit too quickly. As for the food, I found it to be alright, if not all that memorable. The crab croquettes are basically like crab cakes shaped like smaller arancini; I liked the crispiness on the outside, and the crab meat tasted pretty good, but the white dipping sauce was very plain. I did the burger for my main, and while it was filling, I felt it was pretty average and not all that memorable. I went with a side salad, and that too was pretty standard as well.The vibe at the lounge is nice and relaxed, and once you get past 9 PM, having a little live piano music matches the retro ambiance that the Pfister generally projects. That said, it's a nice place to catch up over low background sound than it is a spot that will blow you away with its food and drink selection. It's convenient to those staying at the hotel, but, being someone who has not had the opportunity to explore much else of what Milwaukee has to offer, I would probably check out something else next time.",336,"New York, NY",0,1,1,1

The food is good, the location is historic, and the vibes are great. Apparently, this place is over 40 years old and just crowded everyday of the week. One thing that really stood out to me was the energy and the great vibes, people were really enjoying themselves here. Decor-very hip and historic at the same time. The art in the place is simple, yet elegant. The marble floors and bar top give this place a sense of elegance I really liked. The restrooms are dark and fun. It's a very busy place with lots going on. Service-this was the miss for me and the reason for giving them 5 stars. Our waiter was a bit weird and not really helpful with questions about the menu. Food-awesome appetizers!! This was the best part of our dinner. We had the following apps:Hell's Fire Fries-5/5 stars. These are simply amazing and huge portions. The potato's are thick cut and smothered with melted cheese and drizzled with buffalo sauce. Water Chestnuts-5/5 stars. Marinated and wrapped in thick nueske's bacon.

Garnished with a side of mixed greens, red onions and drizzled with vinaigrette. Super tasty!Elsa's Chicken Sandwich-4/5 stars.

It's a great place to go after Jazz in the Park. The drink prices seem a little more reasonable than at some of the surrounding establishments. And the crowd really does vary. The first time I went in it was mainly a younger crowd--possibly because it was after Jazz in the Park. But on my next visit most of the people there were older than me. Sometimes it's kind of a fancier crowd and sometimes more casual. I think it probably changes based on time of day, time of year, etc. The bartenders have always been nice.So I should have read the reviews before I made an early-evening visit last night because I didn't know about the happy hour. I work on the other side of town so it's rare I can make it downtown-ish still in time for happy hour. Most places give you a little discount on drinks but I didn't know the food was free. I thought maybe some people had brought it in for a work get-together. I was only there for one drink before my brow wax appointment down the street anyway so it wasn't a huge loss.

I had a dragons milk beer and and some beer from the Great Dane brewery which was good.The wings come in four sizes and 10 was a little more than I wanted so I opted for the 5 pieces with hot sauce. The wings looked good but the blue cheese sauce looked even better because it looked chunky, chunky means 90% blue cheese crumbles to 10% creamy sauce which was great and more blue cheese than any other wing place. The hot wings were not really hot at all with moist meat and tasty.My wings with blue cheese was better than some of these supposed Milwaukee top 10 lists which I don't believe I ever saw this place on and why has no one posted any pictures on Yelp, I will change that.",271,"Milwaukee, WI",1,5,0,4

For a place that calls itself a Sports Club there really aren't many TV's. There is a really nice patio in back and a good amount of video games plus 2 pool tables. Food - solid bar food. The Irish nachos and quesadilla were above average and worth ordering. Drinks - they've got a pretty strong beer list, so most people will find something to like. If you're a liquor drinker they have something called a ""rum bucket"" that is in fact served in a mini bucket and tasted like vacation. Service - despite us having a group of 25, Tyler made sure no one was high and dry. They really were on top of it and everyone was really nice!Interior - Brewski's is bigger than you think with a large dining room, big patio and semi private side room. That said, things need some TLC - literally every barstool was ripped, shredded or patched with tape - gross. And the carpet in the side room sorely needs replacing or cleaning.

The cheese curds was hot and crisp. The brisket platter came with 2 sides,  which we decided on Mac and cheese and their broccoli. Both the sides were very bland and also wasn't seasoned very well.

They have an wonderful atmosphere, play live music outside on certain times , great view of the water & the view of people boating & more.   We were greeted & gave them our number for us to wait for our table which was 25mins. We did see open tables inside but assumed they did not have a lot staff to serve in that section.   Our waitress Ashley was amazing friendly & great suggestion on the secret drink not on the menu called Firefox.   Our food portions were huge & was surprised that our appetizer's & dinner came all @ once. We do prefer appetizer's first & dinner afterwards though. Our raw oysters & cheese curds were good. We had the seafood pasta, chicken pasta & they were both not seasoned at all. We had to add our own salt & pepper which was disappointing (please season all your food w/ no salt, pepper, garlic or something). Our drinks were great which I had the strawberry Margarita (not sweet), blue moon & the Firefox.   Our suggestions to the cook staff & owner: to please add seasonings to all your food & speak to them about the importance of taste when the right seasoning's are added.   We would love to go back; to try their sandwiches, snow crabs & hoping all other food's will be seasoned to perfection.",266,"Milwaukee, WI",1,1,0,0

We tried a couple places, since no one takes reservations anymore, and then headed over to Twisted Fisherman on a beautiful Saturday evening.Happily, we were able to get seats at the bar while we waited for our table. The bar service was friendly, but kind of scattered. We later learned they were having a training night. Training is important, but maybe they should do it on a less crowded night.When we got seated we had an extremely friendly waitress. She was funny and warm. Alas, they seemed greatly understaffed.Food took forever. Drinks took forever. We didn't get any appetizers until every dinner was gone and all the drinks were empty. It was kind of chaotic.Overall, the food and drink were good. The sea bass special pan fried was great. The potatoes not so much - they were bland, lacking salt and cheese. The bisque and chowder were both big hits. We'd try it again.The view is great and the boaters act like a floor show (and DJ) as they swing in and out.But I'm pretty sure the timing alone required a manager to apologize.

I had to take to Yelp to post about my most recent visit because I'm still talking about the meal I enjoyed! I met my fam there the day they were putting the boat back in the water and it also happened to be one of the first times people could eat on Twisted's patio, post-quarantine. They've got a great deck filled with yellow picnic tables so we snagged one of those. Thumbs up for the drink specials, always. I had my fave - Deep Eddys lemon vodka and soda - can't go wrong. The blacked tilapia sandwich is normally my go-to, but they had halibut on special that I couldn't pass up. It came to the table and to my surprise, it was a huge portion. A thick, blackened, and well-seasoned piece of fish to make all of my seafood dreams come true. The meal came with two sides so I went with broccoli and baked beans.Our server, Lisa, was great and super friendly (+ wearing a mask).

I met them around 5 o'clock on a Saturday night. I have never been here before. The outside area is huge, during the winter months the inside area is much smaller  but has a nice large bar and booths surrounding the bar on three sides.We sat at the bar for a cocktail first and then moved to a booth for dinner a little bit later. They have a lot of fun specialty cocktails like mai tai's, daiquiris, piña colada's, Bahama mamas, and Mojito's to name a few. They also offer a variety of beers and tappers.The staff was very friendly, after we are done at the bar we went and sat at a booth to order dinner. Their menu has a variety of appetizers, soups and salads and entrées. I'm a huge fan of seafood so I was very excited to see that they offered many seafood items. We started out with two different appetizers the muscles and the barbecue chicken wings. My friends ordered the Dungeoness crab dinner along with a side of snow crab and steak and two sides. I wasn't super hungry so I just decided to order a cheeseburger with a side of garlic cheddar mashed.So to be perfectly honest the food was just alright. It was nothing that blew me away. The muscles were in a garlic wine sauce however there was such an overpowering taste of lemon in the sauce it was just too much citrus. So I wouldn't order those again. The barbecue wings were OK pretty standard nothing super spectacular. My burger was subpar to say the least, the bun was kind of hard and the burger was not as juicy as I would have liked. My friend let me try his Dungeoness crab and the snow crab and the snow crab was so much better. So if you're going to get crab there I would recommend getting the snow crab legs. My other friend did enjoy her steak along with her two sides. The french fries are fine but the garlic cheddar mashed or a little greasy.So my overall thought is I would go back but I'd do it in the summertime when you can sit outside and enjoy the beautiful weather and a delicious cocktail. As for eating there I will definitely order the snow crab leg dinner or maybe try another seafood option the next time I go.",415,"Milwaukee, WI",1,3,0,1

The first time, several months ago was average so I wanted to try it again for my daughter's birthday.This evening was so poor that I felt I needed to write a review. It was extremely disappointing. I'll give a rundown from start to finish.The restaurant was not full, so I expect that service should be good if not great. It wasn't. The young lady was kind enough, but we had to ask for water 3 times. I requested bread (a surcharge not mentioned). When ten minutes passed, and the appetizer was brought, it still wasn't there. When I asked, she apologized, said it was being toasted. After about 2 minutes, the busboy came with bread, and you guessed it, it was not toasted. I detest lying.My daughter's got the braised beef on polenta. Don't order it if you have a weak stomach. It looked like dark cat food (disintegrated meat) on top of a pile polenta. They need to seriously look at that dish.I ordered the pasta. When a chef decides to mix a variety of unusual ingredients, you trust that they get it right, or just make something that is less complex but good. Unfortunately, this chef was not to be trusted. I'm glad I ordered the bread.I did mention my daughter's birthday and they acknowledged it. I suppose a scoop of ice cream or cookie with a candle would have been nice, but nothing ever came. When my other daughter asked them, they said it's too expensive to give out their specialty desserts. Again, a cookie or brownie with a candle?On the positive side, the desserts are fabulous. My suggestion is to go for a late night drink and dessert at the bar and leave the dinner reservations to restaurants that get the food and service right.",310,"Racine, WI",0,0,0,0

The negatives - their menu does not match the one they have posted. I tend to look ahead at the online menu prior to going out so I know what I want to order and am typically excited about it. They had some amazing sounding croquettes on their online menu but they were not on the regular menu, so that was disappointing. I was also disappointed with how small and uncreative the brunch menu seemed. The salads were pretty standard, there were two unique sounding brunch dishes of the six or so that were on the menu.

We got meatballs to start as an appetizer and the outside was very tough and chewy, almost as if it had been sitting under a heat lamp for awhile. One of us got the burger and had the same issue, chewy/tough on the outside. The pork chop was also fairly dry and not cooked well. The braised beef was OK but wasn't super interesting flavor wise. Also, three of the dishes were already out for the night by 630 which happens but it's a smallish menu and was most of our groups top choices.

This is one of those places that is actually easier to access by water! Barnacle Bud's is nestled along one of the busier parts of the Kinnickinnic River. It's more of the industrial/Jones Island part of town, so the view isn't spectacular, but there is a very nice view of the Allen-Bradley clock tower. There's lots of dock space, and in nice weather, it's a great spot to stop when you're boating down the river. For the non-boaters among us (myself included), accessing Barnacle Bud's by land is a bit trickier. It's hidden behind a huge boating warehouse and signage is limited. If you feel like you are heading down a dead-end service road, you're headed the right way! Honestly though, all of this just adds to the quirky appeal.  The place itself is pure nautical kitsch. The servers are great, and the drinks are usually strong. The menu is your standard bar food fare with a seafood twist - think fish fry, grouper Ruebens, coconut shrimp, etc. I really enjoy their crab cake appetizer a lot. The food is always good, but my only complaint is that it is VERY greasy.

That means chemically altered neurotransmitters prevent the possibility of ever remembering anyone's name.

Parking for the event is in a back lot across from the venue and depending on the show or if you pre-order a parking space I spent $20. There is free street parking and if you get there early you could get a spot but I didn't know that so I had pre-ordered a spot in the lot. The building is on the older side but it's a historical building so I'll just say it adds character. It is dimly lit so getting good pictures in there is kind of tough. You'll have to use flash or find certain spots that may have light. Once you enter you're in the lobby and then you go to either the rave or the eagle club. I was in the rave for my show. They have plenty if bars but be aware they are cash bars and it gets expensive. Even for just plain water it was expensive not even bottled water. If you are not a fan of standing the whole time I would recommend getting VIP tickets so you can go to the balcony. You've free to roam all around but definitely having the option of sitting is great and there's a bathroom up there that doesn't get super crowded because it's only for VIP. One thing about this place I didn't like was the floors. They were gross. You couldn't see how gross the floor was you just felt it as you walked along. Whether sticky, slimy, or slippery never really knew what you were going to be walking on. I would say I was scared for the sound because his opener did not have great quality and I was like if Jesse McCartneys audio is just as bad I would have had a huge problem.  Thankfully all of his stuff worked and the show was amazing. It's a pretty decent venue I'd go to another concert here.

We got free tasters before, during and after, along with a free pint glass. 110% worth the price, and I would recommend it to all Milwaukee tourists. 10 minutes after the tour started, a bachelorette party arrived. They immediately started causing problems, and most of them were talking throughout the tour. At one point the tour guide noticed that they were bothering other people on the tour, and he asked them to please be quiet. The mother of the bride proceeded to walk out, giving the middle finger to the tour guide a few moments later. Despite this ridiculously rude interruption, the tour guide managed to keep the attention of the rest of the people Interested in the tour, and it didn't slow him down one bit. He continued giving a great tour, and we could not have been happier to attend. On top of that, the management was amazing, and the beer was great, too.

But to be clear, some of this review is for Bottlehouse 42 inside of MKE Brewing. They are connected and both owned by F Street Hospitality so they are cousins if you put them in one space. If one lacks so does the other.My favorite things about this location:1.) Firepits and chairs outside (awesome)2.) The building itself is neato3.) There are many beautiful plants inside (I love plants)4.) The beer is pretty goodA couple of things that weren't so great:1.) None of the Bottlehouse 42 bartenders were wearing masks. Currently there is a Milwaukee mask advisory so that's worth mentioning. 2.) There's some confusion regarding where to go for a beer if you're taking the tour and what do to with these dang drink chips! (Tip: they can't be used at this location).3.) Women's bathroom was messy with paper towel all over the place, men's bathroom had a broken paper towel dispenser.4.) The bar employees at Bottlehouse were not very friendly or attentive. Except for the very first guy who helped us, the rest of the time was not great.No napkins were given with the cheese curds (greasy cheese needs a napkin), which aren't really that good and came burnt. I would not get them again. So when you walk in there is someone at a desk to the right who handles the brewery tour check-ins. There is someone to the left as well but I'm not sure what he was there for, but he was nice and says hello!If you're just there for food or drinks, you can easily walk straight ahead to the large bar with the beautiful plant wall and you'll find yourself at Bottlehouse 42, not MKE Brewery technically. To the right there is a smaller bar which is where you should go to get your free pint if you're doing the tour and possibly overall better service. That would be MKE Brewing's ""bar area"". But you can't order food there, you'd have to order on the app at Bottlehouse and then pick it up at their bar. Confused yet?If you have one of these sacred MKE brewing drink chips, you can't use them at all in this building. The Bottlehouse guy made it apparent he's been asked A LOT about this, and nicely told us we'd have to use them around the corner at the MKE bar. The MKE bar said sorry, they can't be used here. Okay so you can see how this is really just a mess lol. Luckily we just bought beers but it's still something to point out for those who expect to use the chips. Can't they just make it easy and accept the chips at both bars in this building?The fire area outside is my most favorite part. There were maybe 5 fire rings with plenty of chairs and actual wood in the pits! Not gas ones. I will come back just for that part alone and of course to drink beer. I think if you understand where to go for what when you arrive, you'll be fine. Just don't buy the cheese curds.",542,"Milwaukee, WI",1,3,0,0

It's a hard iced coffee drink that includes a dash of milk and a sweet whipped vanilla flavor. As you can see from the pic it is evident that there is milk in it by the lighter color and opaqueness of the liquid. If you have a sweet tooth and love coffee as much as me, then this is for you! The sweet vanilla flavoring is a real homerun in my book. So why did it take me two years to finally try? Well, the one potential drawback for some is that like actual coffee there is caffeine in it (approximately 30 mg). I like drinking as a night cap and that doesn't work well (although this might work well with breakfast....). Like most people I also drink at parties and to celebrate, but there was a minor thing for the past year and a half preventing that (at least for responsible people).  End of tangent, this sweet and creamy cup of joe is Doughboy approved.*There is now a new Salted Caramel version, and I'm excited that there's currently one in my fridge to review!Doughboy_Food_Reviews",204,"Milwaukee, WI",1,0,0,1

I went to the back to check out the menu and was fascinated with this Blue Plate Special.   I decided to try it. I ordered the 2 pork Chops, mashed potatoes and gravy, green beans, or came with 2 Hawaiian rolls and I ordered 1 slice of key lime pie. This was TO GO. SO, I get home, find 2 pieces of pork chop ( boneless) that appears to have come from one chop. They had the nice looking black searing on the meat, but these were so dry it took extra chewing, hard to swallow.  That was disappointing!! Then there was the broccoli in place of my green beans that I didn't want.  I thought the mashed potatoes and gravy would comfort me a bit, but this spoonful of lumpy potatoes was not only a very small serving, but the gravy on them tasted like it came from a jar.  I definitely was extremely disappointed with the Blue Plate Special, the portion sizes, the flavor and the way it was over cooked!  But wait!!!!!! Remember I ordered key lime pie.... I got a nice size slice of pie that was covered in a white topping that was not whipped cream or cool whip.  It was very thick and broke off in chunks when I put the fork in.  This is not a Topping I've ever had on key lime pie and I've had plenty of key lime pie!!! But worse than the topping, which I scraped off, was the filling!  It was discolored in spots on one side like it was dried out, a last piece that was sitting??? I don't know, but it was not a smooth creamy pie but closer to a piece of hospital pie.  The entire meal was an epic fail!  Flavor, texture, appearance,  portion size...... Not even the dessert could redeem this meal.... I'm not sure what happened here on this night!!!

Another employee came out and scolded us for doing so and we kindly mentioned we were informed that we could. She scoffed that she really shouldn't have told us that but whatever. We sat down and waited about 10 minutes until we were finally informed that we needed to order at the bar. No biggie - we ordered and our food came out.

The service was just ok (they took our order/brought our food...that's about it) but we got what we needed.

Main floor has communal tables as well as host-seated tables, a small reservable room, and the upstairs is wide open with ping pong, foosball, and has large event capability (350), so it's definitely on my radar as an event planner. I sat at a communal table on the first floor, since I couldn't get a seat at one of the just three seats available at the bar (more bar seats!). Communal tables order food and beer at the bar. I tried one of the pizzas and it was phenomenal- Margherita with cherry peppers. Try the pizzas.I wouldn't mind seeing food and beer service at the communal tables. Good City service could be a little more service-minded, from time to time. I'm aware that self-serve beer and food is a trend from Ballast Point Chicago to here, but it could trend away, in my opinion. This location will have flexibility to brew different types of beer than their East Side location, and they plan on focusing on sours. For the grand opening I had a cask exclusive of their Mama Tried with Orange Peel. Also had the Clean Cut, which is a consistently good IPA. (Motto, Risk, Reward are always good, too!).

The favorite of our table was the Debutante, made with Ketel One Grapefruit Rose Vodka, Clover Elderflower Gin, Lime, Mint, and Tonic. Food is not served regularly here, although it does have occasional pop-up food events. And don't plan on coming here for a late-night cocktail--the place closes at 10:30 pm Thursday to Saturday and 8:30 pm Sunday. If you want a quiet place to visit with friends over great cocktails, I can highly recommend the Dubble Dutch Tavern.",201,"Milwaukee, WI",1,1,0,0

It's a shame because had the Asian female bartender been a little more accommodating or hell even smiled I would have spent more then $20 at this place. Just because she was rude I choose not to order drinks. In fact I requested a water just to inconvenience her as she was soooo unbearably rude. I definitely wouldn't ever recommend this place to anyone no matter how amazing the decor or atmosphere is. The Bartender legit destroyed any opportunity of my return.

The place is the typical neighborhood bar with a covered patio for smokers and U shaped bar with a pool table in back and gaming machines. They have 12 taps with a nice selection for a neighborhood bar I thought. As I walked in for the first time I was greeted with a hello by a person at the gaming machine and everyone was friendly and I even got a complement from another person at the bar so it's a friendly place for first timers. As always I ordered agin Rickey and the bar tender had no idea what it is so I had to explain it to her. It looks like frozen pizza is all they have for hot food after watching a woman at the bar get cheese bread from the pizza oven.

As I was climbing over a snow bank to reach a parking meter, I saw a fellow at the meter with a handful of clubs. I asked, ""Where are you going to swing those?"" He replied, ""Turn around ... right there!"" Well I'll be darned. Sure enough. An indoor driving range and a putting green. Just what I was thinking this area needed for those enduring Milwaukee's long, cold winter and Jonesing to swing some sticks.And they took it one step farther: they sell beer too.Mmm. Beer.Not the fanciest of varieties, but it's something. When I first discovered the place, I was en route to meeting up with my wife for dinner and drinks elsewhere. After a short night out on the town, we returned to my car which was still parked in front of Fore! Milwaukee. The lights were still on inside and we spied a beer sign (Coors maybe?). Since neither of us had swung a club in at least 3 months and it was Friday night, we decided to enter and find out what the place was about. Within moments I had the top popped off of a Rolling Rock and I was slamming Titleists into a backstop with TaylorMade's latest model driver. Boy did that feel good. My wife whacked a few with a late model Lady Hogan. If it could've fit into her purse, she might have smuggled it out of there -- she was striking some sweet drives with that thing!Soon, Fore! Milwaukee will be adding a few golf simulators. That will really complete the indoor golfing experience. I haven't used a simulator in years, but I always enjoyed those.

I've actually never really met an item I didn't enjoy. In the end I went for the quinoa veggie bowl, and it was a win. It included roasted peppers, kale, wild mushrooms, butternut squash, cilantro, and topped with an over easy egg + a roasted tomato sauce/medley. Both very flavorful and satiating!

We ordered the beignets, brew city Benedict, and the hot mess for food. For drinks we got the Spicy Badger Bloody Mary and the Berry Blast 'mosa.  We finished up with a Cafe au Lait and a regular coffee. The beignets came with a chocolate dipping sauce. These were really great, but go easy on the chocolate sauce it can overpower the flavor if you don't.The Hot Mess lives up to its name by how it looks alone. It was a perfect mix of sausage, Hashbrown, egg, veggies, and sauce.  I didn't add a lick of seasoning to it and it was amazing just as it came from the kitchen. The Brew City Benedict came out with cubed potatoes and this was another plate that didn't require any seasoning. It's rare you get potatoes from a kitchen and you don't need salt or pepper.  The homemade biscuits and sauce over the eggs tied so well together that each bite was phenomenal. The spicy badger wasn't as spicy as I had hoped for but it was still a solid Bloody Mary.  The berry blast mosa was really good and you can't go wrong getting it.  The coffees were also amazing. What stole the show though was the downright perfect service we received.  Our server Britt was extremely helpful, quick to get anything asked for, and never out of touch long.  The entire staff was cheerful and nice and I can't imagine anyone having a bad experience here.",260,"Kenosha, WI",0,0,0,0

So: they deserve five stars if you'd like to imbibe. Go for it.)If you want to eat though, wait until you've had a few and the food might be okay. After all you've got to eat something, right? A good example of underwhelming and odd cuisine: we had a beet dish. The beets were roasted, dehydrated, then rehydrated...(Or were they dehydrated, rehydrated then roasted?) Whatever the order, they were murdered.  I did not know you could kill a beet. We had a salad of tomatoes, zucchini and greens. The tomatoes were exquisitely fresh and real, like they haven't tasted since my childhood, in the 1960s. Unlike the other salad ingredients, their fulsome flavor was not ruined by the dressing, which was indistinct, kind of bland, not interesting. I would have preferred the other ingredients plain. I apologize, but I can't remember the ingredients. All I know is that I don't ever want to have that taste in my mouth again. (Please note that I have eaten delicacies and gourmet foods in numerous countries, on four continents, and I'm neither a philistine, nor a snob.) Six dishes, a dessert and one canned drink came out to $140 (including a mandatory 20% gratuity.) Ouch. Way too much for the smallest of not-enough-to-share dishes.

Oh and also, all the drinks come in snifter glasses.????Okay, so I'm not usually a fan of super specific, hipstery themes like this. But I decided to give Snifters a chance. And I'll admit, I liked what they had to offer. The signature dish seems to be the empanadas. These empanadas, however, are filled with unusual ingredients. We ended up getting The Manchester (basically mac and cheese stuffed in an empanada. Decent, but confusing to the senses), The Appalachia (pulled pork sandwich empanada. Solidly good), and The Cream City Standard (beans and potatoes. Easily my favorite, most similar to a traditional empanada). Overall, the empanadas were tasty, despite their oddness! We then moved on to an entree option. I went with Los Camarones, which were giant breaded shrimp served on top of cornbread. The shrimp was excellent. Very flavorful and delicious. The dish as a whole, I thought, lacked a sauce on top. It was a bit dry overall. My friend got the chicken and waffles, which was delightfully served with the maple syrup in a snifter glass. She was a big fan, so it must have been delicious. Overall, I'm surprised how much I enjoyed Snifters. I had hesitations, but the food was unique and flavorful. My big issue: the service was painfully slow. As in, I had to get up and find our server myself, which automatically knocks one star off in my books.

As soon as you walk in, you can tell the owners put a lot of work into the ""Old"" Texture.  It's well-lit, beautifully decorated and welcoming.  I loved the ambiance, I hated the drinks! Our first bartender seemed pretty knowledgeable of the place, the history of the locale and was an overall friendly guy.  I asked for an Old Fashioned, which were reviewed as the best.  I HIGHLY disagree! It was next to awful.  The minute I saw him dump almost half a can of Squirt into my drink, I knew it was over. I asked for a Bourbon Old Fashioned (sour).  I got a shot of Bourbon, some muddled fruit and a ton of soda.  I drank it but honestly couldn't stand the flavor.  Fast forward to the female bartender that walked in eating out of a bowl behind the bar. Not only was it unprofessional at best, but her hair kept getting in the way of her cutting limes. Clearly, she didn't get the memo that you don't eat behind a bar and you make sure your long hair is either tied back or kept away from all the ice, liquor, fruit, etc. I  get the whole concept of a pretty face behind a bar, but someone  who is no where prepared to make a drink or satisfy the customer should really take a course in mixology 101.  Now, I should mention, she was quite apologetic when I complained about my drink and offered a new one BUT she didn't know how to make an Old Fashioned in the first place so why promote what your staff can't follow through on? I was worried when she didn't muddle any fruit and filled the entire glass with just ice.  I stopped her dead in her tracks ( former bartender here) and walked her through the basics.  Unfortunately, she made me a Bourbon with almost 2 limes squeezed into it. At that point I was over it. I ordered a beer and made my way downstairs and danced the night away. It's a great and fun place without the added drama that places on that block have been known for. It was refreshing to see an older crowd with a keen sense of class.

The bartenders are always so friendly, even when it's busy and things are a little crazy. I feel like everyone at Newport knows each other. It's a classic neighborhood bar and a great place to get to know your neighbors. The patio is a plus too!",53,"Milwaukee, WI",1,1,0,1

Decent craft beer, but cheap shit beer too.  String mixers and no nonsense.  Not sure if there is a Franky, but if there is he's doing something right.  This was one of the best bars we hit on our trip to Millywalkayyy.  If you live there and haven't been you should go, if your visiting (when you can now) you should Mark this one down.  It's a friendly good natured bar where the crowd wants to be friendly, drink, and have a good time.  This is the kind of place where the entire crowd is having a good time, no downers.  Thanks",132,"Greenville, RI",0,4,3,4

They have an adorable puppy (see pictures) who is not always there but when he is, the cuteness factor is through the roof. The bartenders are always friendly, attentive, and professional. They have various leagues like volleyball on Tuesdays so the bar is actually pretty hip and happening throughout the week if you're looking to socialize :)",69,"Lacey, WA",0,1,0,2

It's a corner bar that looks like a house and has Patch, the dog, as it's lovable but gruff mascot. Agreed with others that this is a no frills corners bar that comes along with good (sometimes live) music, reasonably priced drinks, lots of televisions for the games and great bartenders and people. Pull tab machine in tow and some decent grub during Packers games. Note: it DID just get a new line with a bunch of new taps, so maybe there are some frills.It's a quality place and we will continue to be regulars.",132,"Bay View, Milwaukee, WI",0,7,0,6
